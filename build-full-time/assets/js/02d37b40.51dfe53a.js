One big issue is that it doesn't always make sense for an object to inherit all the functionality of another kind of object. This is more of an issue with classical inheritance, since prototypal inheritance can be targeted to individual objects and not just classes. As our codebases get more complex, we could end up in a situation where we're stuck giving objects all kinds of functionality that they don't need \u2014 and some of that unneeded functionality could lead to bugs as well as code that's hard to understand. Joe Armstrong, the creator of the functional language Erlang, has the perfect quote for this issue: \"You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.\""),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"There are several other issues with classical inheritance. Imagine you're building an application that characterizes the behavior of various mammals. For that reason, you decide to start with a ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Mammal")," class and to add various methods that should presumably apply to all mammals. As your application begins to grow, however, not all the methods apply to all of the mammals inheriting from the ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Mammal")," class. After all, there's a lot of variance in the animal kingdom \u2014 and by the time you need to add a ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Platypus")," class, the entire application is in desperate need of a refactor. If only the ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Reptile")," and ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Bird")," classes allow for egg-laying methods, how would that method be incorporated into ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Platypus"),"?
