The specific languages, tools, and approaches you&#x27;ll learn here are much less important than the general skills of solving problems. </p><p>Successful programmers embrace the limitations of what they can know, and get good at figuring out what they don&#x27;t know. They develop a mindset in which not knowing the answer isn&#x27;t a source of anxiety, but rather an opportunity to learn and explore.</p><p>Our best advice is to not think of Epicodus as a place to learn Ruby, React, C#, JavaScript, or some other language or tool. Instead, think of it as a place to learn how to learn.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="growth-mindset"><a href="#growth-mindset">Growth Mindset</a><a href="#growth-mindset" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to growth-mindset" title="Direct link to growth-mindset">​</a></h2><p>As part of your pre-class work, you&#x27;ll read about the growth mindset. Here&#x27;s a quick explanation made of excerpts from that article:</p><blockquote><p>Researchers have known for some time that the brain is like a muscle; that the more you use it, the more it grows.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Neural connections form and deepen most when we make mistakes doing difficult tasks rather than repeatedly having success with easy ones.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Our intelligence is not fixed, and the best way that we can grow our intelligence is to embrace tasks where we might struggle and fail.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>People with growth mindsets correctly believe that capability and intelligence can be grown through effort, struggle and failure.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Mindsets can be taught; they&#x27;re malleable.</p></blockquote><p>If you have a growth mindset — if you enjoy challenging yourself and view your failures as opportunities to learn, not mistakes to be ashamed of — you&#x27;ll be much more successful at Epicodus. Work on developing a growth mindset. Your teachers will help guide you in that direction.</p><p>An important part of this growth mindset is to measure your progress against yourself, and not against other students. It&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ve previously used your brain as intensely as you will at Epicodus, and getting used to this kind of a mental workout is hard enough without adding the pressure of comparing yourself to others. Everybody has their own way and pace of learning and retaining information, and often that pace ebbs and flows throughout the class. Go at a pace that&#x27;s right for you, and avoid comparing your progress to other students&#x27;. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="code-of-conduct"><a href="#code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a><a href="#code-of-conduct" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to code-of-conduct" title="Direct link to code-of-conduct">​</a></h2><p>At Epicodus, students spend all of their time working together, in pairs and often in groups of pairs. We have observed that, in both learning and practicing software development, people learn more and write better software when working together than when working alone.</p><p>Such close collaboration requires that students at Epicodus commit to supporting and respecting each other.</p><p>To participate in Epicodus, you must agree to:</p><ul><li><strong>Be kind to others.</strong> Most of the time, this should be easy. (If this is something you have trouble with on a regular basis, you shouldn&#x27;t enroll in Epicodus.) Occasionally, this will be difficult, especially with people you don&#x27;t like, or with people who have not been kind to you. Nevertheless, under all circumstances, you agree to be kind to others.</li><li><strong>Assume others&#x27; good intentions.</strong> When someone does something that feels unkind to you, assume that person has good intentions. Perhaps they did not mean to be unkind. Perhaps they are in a bad mood. Perhaps you did something that hurt them without realizing it.</li><li><strong>Help other students be kind to you.</strong> <em>Intention</em> is different than <em>impact</em>. Even when you assume others&#x27; good intentions, others&#x27; behaviors and actions can impact you in negative ways. If someone does something that hurts or offends you, talk to them about what they did and how it hurt you. If you are not comfortable talking to them, ask a teacher or friend to help you talk to that person.</li><li><strong>Respect people&#x27;s differences.</strong> Students at Epicodus are of diverse races, genders, sexual orientations, abilities, ages, religions, economic statuses, and many other differences. Don&#x27;t assume anything about someone&#x27;s ability or personality because of such differences, and don&#x27;t say anything hurtful about who they are. If you aren&#x27;t sure if something might be hurtful, don&#x27;t say it. Do not make assumptions about a person&#x27;s gender pronouns, and use the gender pronoun the person requests such as she, he, or they.</li><li><strong>Don&#x27;t make others feel uncomfortable.</strong> Different people have different feelings and expectations about sex and romance. Sexual harassment can take many forms and it can be difficult to anticipate what conduct may be offensive or unwelcome to others. Be respectful to your classmates: if you aren&#x27;t sure if something will make someone uncomfortable, don&#x27;t do it.</li><li><strong>Work hard and stay focused.</strong> The highly collaborative nature of the class means that your classmates will be relying on you to come to class for the entire day, every day, for the entire course, unless you are sick or have a personal emergency. During class, stay focused on your work. Turn off your cell phone and don&#x27;t check email, Facebook, or any other website that does not relate to the work at hand.</li><li><strong>Take care of yourself.</strong> Get enough sleep on school nights. Eat well. Exercise for at least 20 minutes every day, even if it&#x27;s just walking. It will make you a better coder, and a better teammate to your classmates.</li><li><strong>Treat school the way you would a job.</strong> Epicodus is training for a career, so treat other students with the same professional courtesy you would co-workers, and your teacher and other staff with the same respect you would a work supervisor.</li></ul><p>Hopefully, this Code of Conduct is how you strive to behave anyways. If it is not, you should probably not enroll in Epicodus. The Epicodus staff will have the final say in the interpretation of this Code, and if they decide you have violated it, they will ask you to leave the class.</p><p>Epicodus is an opportunity not just to learn web development, but to practice working closely with others. On the rare occasions that you find such close collaboration difficult, we hope this Code of Conduct will be your guide.</p><p>All students and staff must follow our Code of Conduct. If you violate the Code of Conduct, your teacher or another Epicodus staff will talk with you about what you did, why it violated the Code of Conduct, and document the meeting by sending you an email. If you violate the Code of Conduct a second time, you will be expelled and may not re-apply.</p><p>Epicodus&#x27;s management may, in their sole discretion, deem your first violation malicious and expel you without previous warning. Examples of malicious violations include using racial slurs or making threats of violence.</p><p>If you&#x27;ve witnessed or been subject to behavior from another student that violates Epicodus&#x27;s Code of Conduct, please inform a staff member.</p><p>We realize that you may experience a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable or unwelcome, but that isn&#x27;t a clear violation of the Code of Conduct, and that you may not feel comfortable sharing with a staff member. In this type of situation, you may fill out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6RW9r2A0-UOcSb-k-7nAWDjv0KVwd5gPzFWc9UzLg1irpwQ/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anonymous complaint form</a>. Form submissions are sent to the Director of Opertations. This form is anonymous and the information you share cannot be used to take concrete action against a student, such as determining a Code of Conduct violation. However, Epicodus staff may use this information to inform the student of the impact of their action and ask them to be mindful of that impact in their future behavior.</p><h1><a href="#class-structure">Class Structure</a></h1><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pairing"><a href="#pairing">Pairing</a><a href="#pairing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to pairing" title="Direct link to pairing">​</a></h2><p>Most days, you&#x27;ll spend your classroom time at Epicodus pair programming, in which you&#x27;ll share a computer, keyboard, and mouse with another student. We&#x27;ve found pair programming to work really well in our classroom for several reasons:</p><ul><li>You catch each other&#x27;s mistakes, typos, and bugs.</li><li>You learn to communicate about your code.</li><li>It forces you to look at your code from another&#x27;s perspective.</li><li>Knowledge, ideas, and approaches diffuse quickly around the classroom.</li><li>Working with someone else keeps you focused and productive.</li><li>It&#x27;s fun and you get to know your classmates really well!</li></ul><p>From past classes, we&#x27;ve seen that teamwork and communication skills are more important than coding skills when it comes to applying for jobs. So use pairing as a way to intentionally build your skills in these areas!</p><p>All that said, pairing has its drawbacks, the main one being that some of your pairs will learn at a different pace than you. In time, you will find other students who work at about the same pace as you. However, you&#x27;ll also regularly “pair up” and “pair down”. Some days you&#x27;ll “pair up&quot; with somebody who understands the concepts better than you: take these opportunities to learn from your pair. Some days you&#x27;ll “pair down&quot; with someone who understands the concepts less than you: take these opportunities to better cement your own understanding by explaining to your pair. </p><p>The terms &quot;pairing up&quot; and &quot;pairing down&quot; simply compare where each person is at in terms of knowledge and understanding of that class session&#x27;s concepts. In no way should this be used to evaluate a person&#x27;s intelligence or capacity to become a developer. We expect that Epicodus students have varying levels of previous experience. Some people struggle with one concept but quickly grasp another. Some people may have studied coding previously. Others may have had to deal with structural disadvantages in the past, such as not growing up with a computer in the house, being discouraged from pursuing technical careers, or dealing with other life issues. Still others may be dealing with personal issues in the moment — whether a lack of sleep the night before or other long-term stresses.</p><p>Please refrain from making value judgments about your peers (or yourself!) based on your perceived difference in skill sets. When you are pairing up or down, stay focused on learning and respectful collaboration. Both pairs should take initiative to switch who is driving regularly and engage each other with questions about problem solving. </p><p>It&#x27;s important to work with a wide variety of people, including people at your same level of understanding. If you always pair down, you won&#x27;t push your limits. If you always pair up, you&#x27;ll find that even if you think you understand a concept, you won&#x27;t be able to implement it yourself. If you have a couple days in a row where your pairs haven&#x27;t been well-matched, talk with a teacher. Overall, you should expect that you will regularly pair up and pair down throughout the program.</p><p>Less frequently, pairing can be difficult because of different learning styles or personality conflicts. Take some time to talk to your pair about your learning style before you start: do you take a lot of notes, talk things through before starting, or explore lots of tangents? Finding out about your pair&#x27;s style and discussing what to do if you have different approaches or priorities can help you avoid conflicts later. If you do end up in a situation where you&#x27;re feeling frustrated or uncomfortable, your pair is probably feeling that way too. Take a deep breath, take a break if you need to, and then talk about it with them. It&#x27;s tough, but it&#x27;s better than suffering through the day: talking about it will relieve the tension. Ask a teacher if you need help having that conversation. Remember that everybody will have difficult pairs, especially at first. But the experience is worth it. It&#x27;s an extremely valuable skill to be able to work effectively with a wide array of people. Having this skill will make you more prepared to contribute as a member of a team at your internship or your next job in tech.</p><p>Pairing is a requirement of attending Epicodus. If there&#x27;s an odd number of students, form a group of three. If you aren&#x27;t able to pair for some other reason, notify your teacher at the beginning of class. Working solo counts as being absent from class, and the attendance policy applies regardless of whether you miss class by not showing up or by not pairing and participating fully.</p><p>Until the end of the class, when we&#x27;ll work on larger projects, you&#x27;ll switch pairs every day. Finding pairs can be awkward, especially at first. It&#x27;s fine to just jump in, introduce yourself, and then get started. To make finding pairs easier, every course section we assign you to a development team (dev team) of about eight students to work and check in with. Every class session, you&#x27;ll find a new pair from your dev team to work with.</p><p>We want everybody to feel part of our community at Epicodus. We often see students forming cliques. You can help prevent this by switching pairs every day, and resisting the temptation to pair with the same people over and over.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="class-and-homework-format"><a href="#class-and-homework-format">Class and Homework Format</a><a href="#class-and-homework-format" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to class-and-homework-format" title="Direct link to class-and-homework-format">​</a></h2><p>The only way to become a programmer is to spend a lot of time programming, and Epicodus is designed to maximize the time you spend actually programming.</p><p>For classwork each day, you&#x27;ll be assigned a new project, and each day, you&#x27;ll work with a different pair (towards the end of the program, you may work on longer projects). For homework, you&#x27;ll have approximately an hour of lessons introducing you to new concepts and tools. Some  days will have lighter or heavier loads of lessons to read, depending on the week&#x27;s material. You&#x27;re expected to go through the lessons on your own but not to code along with them or understand them completely. If you have the time, it is recommended to code along with the homework. Likewise, there are no lectures in class — that&#x27;s what the homework is for. Each weekend will also have a set of lessons that you&#x27;ll need to read through before beginning work in class the following  week.</p><p>For our full-stack programs, there will be a career services related curriculum that runs aside your coding assignments. For the full-time full-stack program, the calendar for that can be found <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/career-services-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. For the part-time full-stack program, the calendar for that can be found <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming-part-time/getting-started-at-epicodus/career-services-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. There will be time set aside during class to complete these assignments.</p><p>It&#x27;s crucial that you spend the time to read the lessons before class, so you and your partners can use your time together most effectively to implement those concepts. It is unfair to both your pair, and yourself, if you do not come to class prepared.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assessment"><a href="#assessment">Assessment</a><a href="#assessment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to assessment" title="Direct link to assessment">​</a></h2><p>At the end of most weeks, you&#x27;ll work alone on an independent project that will help you make sure you understand the topic for the week and identify any gaps in your knowledge. You shouldn&#x27;t ask other students or your teachers for help.</p><p>For the full-time programs, you&#x27;ll have all day Friday to complete your individual project from home. You are expected to work between 8am and 5pm PST, unless you get pre-approval from an instructor to work during different hours. Initial submissions for assignments are due on Fridays at 5 pm.</p><p>For the part-time programs, you will have all weekend to complete your individual project. You are expected to work a minimum of four hours on this project. Initial submissions for assignments are due on Sundays at 9 am.</p><p>The following week, your teacher will give you feedback on your project either in person, on a video call, or in writing. Every outstanding project gets one review each week.</p><p>Career services assignments will all have dedicated time in class to work on them. Advisors will discuss the assignments with students ahead of the dedicated class time, and give feedback on assignments in the following week. The assignments for career services can be found in Epicenter in the Internship course.</p><p>All assignments, grades, and feedback are available in Epicenter.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="requirements"><a href="#requirements">Requirements</a><a href="#requirements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to requirements" title="Direct link to requirements">​</a></h2><p>Each assignment contains several objectives. Your teacher or advisor will assess whether your project meets each objective <em>all of the time</em>, <em>most of the time</em>, or <em>none of the time</em>. You must meet all of the objectives <em>most of the time</em> or <em>all of the time</em> in order to pass. </p><p>On Epicenter we assign each grade a color to help differentiate between passing and failing:</p><ul><li><em>All of the time</em> is green and is a passing grade.</li><li><em>Most of the time</em> is yellow and is a passing grade.</li><li><em>None of the time</em> is red and is a failing grade.</li></ul><p>You must submit your project by the specified deadline. There are three deadlines for any given project:</p><ul><li>Initial submission: this is the first due date.<ul><li>Due at 5 pm on Friday for full-time students.</li><li>Due at 9 am on Sunday for part-time students. </li></ul></li><li>Resubmission: this is always 10 days after the project was assigned.<ul><li>Due at 8 am on Monday for full-time students.</li><li>Due at 9 am on Sunday for part-time students. </li></ul></li><li>Final deadline: this is always 17 days after the project was assigned.<ul><li>Due at 8 am on Monday for full-time students.</li><li>Due at 9 am on Sunday for part-time students. </li></ul></li></ul><p>Once you are passing a project, there&#x27;s nothing more required of you. You can tell whether you&#x27;ve passed or failed a project by your feedback on Epicenter. </p><p>If you do not meet the objectives on your initial submission, you&#x27;ll need to resubmit your project. It&#x27;s commonplace for students to do a resubmission and the feedback will direct you on what&#x27;s missing. Keep in mind that you do not have to wait until the resubmission deadline to turn in your project — we welcome you to turn in resubmissions early.</p><p>If your project is not passing all objectives by the resubmission deadline, 10 days after the project was assigned, you&#x27;ll be given an Academic Warning and you will have one additional week to meet all objectives on your project by the final deadline.</p><p>After the final deadline on any project, we will no longer accept any submissions. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-academic-warning-policy"><a href="#the-academic-warning-policy">The Academic Warning Policy</a><a href="#the-academic-warning-policy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-academic-warning-policy" title="Direct link to the-academic-warning-policy">​</a></h2><p>Epicodus staff will give an Academic Warning to a student when an assignment is not passing objectives after the resubmission deadline. The warning is intended to communicate that the project is near the final deadline.</p><p>The number of times you have been given an Academic Warning is tracked in Epicenter. If you have been given three Academic Warnings, your advisor(s) and teacher(s) will meet with you to discuss your academic standing, which includes the possibility of retaking all or part of the coursework or being asked to leave the program. </p><p>For students participating in the Income Share Agreement (ISA), you agreed to higher academic standards. If you do not meet those standards, you agreed to be removed from the ISA program. Please review the requirements around Academic Warnings in <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/student-handbook#income-share-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the student handbook&#x27;s section on the ISA</a>.  </p><p>We will notify you by email if you are given an Academic Warning. Additionally, a red banner will appear in your Epicenter account to indicate you currently have a project nearing the final deadline. It is possible to have multiple projects with Academic Warnings at once. We list the number of times that you have been given an Academic Warning on the Courses tab on Epicenter.</p><p>Once your project is passing all objectives, we will remove the Academic Warning and Epicenter will no longer have the banner. However, the number of times you&#x27;ve been given an Academic Warning is a permanent count and will not be reset.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="failure-to-meet-requirements"><a href="#failure-to-meet-requirements">Failure to meet requirements</a><a href="#failure-to-meet-requirements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to failure-to-meet-requirements" title="Direct link to failure-to-meet-requirements">​</a></h2><p>Students are required to pass all assignments and keep up with the pace of the program in order to graduate. You will fail to meet course requirements for assignments in two cases:</p><ul><li>If your project is not passing all objectives by the final deadline, 17 days after the project was initially assigned.</li><li>If you&#x27;ve been given an Academic Warning a third time.</li></ul><p>In both of the cases above, this means that you have fallen behind with your coursework. When either situation occurs, your teacher(s) and advisor(s) will meet with you to discuss your academic standing and consider your situation and any contributing factors. We will ask you to either leave the program or retake all or part of the program without being charged any additional tuition, however, if you&#x27;re paying your tuition through a third party, you may be charged extra costs from them. We&#x27;ll extend this offer to retake coursework no more than once. At Epicodus staff discretion, we may make an exception and allow you to continue with your current cohort.</p><p>These policies are in place because it is our responsibility to ensure that when they leave our program, graduates are ready to be successful in their job search and eventual first role as a developer. When students have repeated Academic Warnings or miss the 17 day deadline, this is an indicator that they&#x27;re struggling with either technical or soft skills necessary to succeed.</p><p>We know Epicodus is an intensive and demanding program, and that there are many factors that can contribute to a student falling behind. Because of this, we do see students in every cohort retake all or part of the coursework. For whatever reason if you find yourself struggling, please reach out to an instructor or advisor so they can help you identify the best steps forward.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="academic-honesty"><a href="#academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</a><a href="#academic-honesty" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to academic-honesty" title="Direct link to academic-honesty">​</a></h2><p>The code reviews we do for your individual projects is the main way your teachers can see where your skills are at, and the only chance for you to get feedback on your individual work to make sure that you&#x27;re learning what you need to know to be successful after graduating. If you copy someone else&#x27;s work, you lose out on that feedback about your work. And if you graduated by passing off others&#x27; work as your own, you&#x27;d not only be setting yourself up for failure at their job, but your failure on the job would also hurt the reputation of all other Epicodus students.</p><p>For these reasons, it&#x27;s extremely important that you submit only your own work for individual projects. Students found to have copied others&#x27; work or received help from others will be expelled.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-role-of-teachers"><a href="#the-role-of-teachers">The Role of Teachers</a><a href="#the-role-of-teachers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-role-of-teachers" title="Direct link to the-role-of-teachers">​</a></h2><p>Most of programming is getting stuck and figuring out how to get un-stuck, so asking for help is a balance between struggling with a problem for long enough to build your own problem-solving skills, and not spending too much time and frustration on any one problem. As a guideline, you should spend 20 minutes trying to solve a problem yourself before asking for help. Another tip is if you&#x27;re frustrated and nothing seems to be working, take a walk and get away from your computer screen for a little bit. You&#x27;ll be amazed at what your subconscious can figure out when you let it rest.</p><p>An important skill to develop at Epicodus is understanding other people&#x27;s code. So before you ask a teacher for help, you&#x27;ll ask another pair of students, to give them a chance to try understanding your code and helping you figure out what to do.</p><p>When you do need help from a teacher, you&#x27;ll find that they will ask more questions than provide answers — their goal is to help guide you to the the next step, rather than give you the solution outright. Sometimes, you may even find that if you ask two different teachers for help on the same problem, they give you two different suggestions. Although it can be frustrating at the time to not just get the answer to your problem, our alumni have always thanked us later for making them work through it. And when you come up with the answer yourself, it&#x27;s much more rewarding!</p><p>Before you ask for help, make sure that you have gone through the lesson on debugging for the language you&#x27;re working in and <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/how-to-ask-for-help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to ask for help</a> . Then, put in a help request at the help site for your class (your teacher will tell you on the first day). There are no limits on the number of questions you can ask, and there are certainly no &quot;dumb questions&quot;, so long as you have taken the time to try to figure it out yourself.</p><p>Teachers are not available outside of class hours — your problem-solving struggles should happen during class, so there should be no need to contact your teachers outside of class. Please respect their personal time by not asking them to stay after class to help you.</p><p>Remember, the most important skill you&#x27;ll learn at Epicodus is how to solve problems. Your teachers are merely your guides along this path. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-role-of-advisors"><a href="#the-role-of-advisors">The Role of Advisors</a><a href="#the-role-of-advisors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-role-of-advisors" title="Direct link to the-role-of-advisors">​</a></h2><p>In addition to your teachers, you will have an advisor dedicated to your cohort that will help set you up for success in your job search. Your advisor works with you from the time you begin at Epicodus until you find your first job in the industry. </p><p>You&#x27;ll interact with your advisor on a regular basis throughout class. Each week, your advisor will give an informational talk on a topic related to the career services side of your education at Epicodus. They&#x27;ll also be assessing all non-technical assignments. You can expect to meet individually with your advisor periodically throughout the class to check in about your progress, conduct mock interviews, and answer any questions you have about the job market. Your advisor will also coordinate your internship at the end of class. </p><p>Once you&#x27;ve graduated, your relationship with your advisor doesn&#x27;t end! They&#x27;ll check in with you regularly throughout your job search for any assistance and support you might need, whether that&#x27;s goal setting, application material reviews, or having an accountability buddy to help stay motivated. </p><p>While there are regularly scheduled times to meet with your advisor, please don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out to them as a resource throughout and after the program. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="attendance"><a href="#attendance">Attendance</a><a href="#attendance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to attendance" title="Direct link to attendance">​</a></h2><p>To be counted as present, you must be in class, pairing, not late or left early.</p><p>Your attendance record will appear on your transcript, which will be sent to internship companies as part of the match-making process.

No personally identifying information will be shared.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="communication-expectations"><a href="#communication-expectations">Communication Expectations</a><a href="#communication-expectations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to communication-expectations" title="Direct link to communication-expectations">​</a></h2><p>While you&#x27;re at Epicodus, we&#x27;ll send you important information by email and on Discord.

If you aren&#x27;t already in the habit, check your email at least once a day on class days. </p><p>Email is the best way to reach us. Not all of Epicodus staff roles use Discord in the same way, so please don&#x27;t direct message us there.</p><p>Sometimes, you may not be able to provide information we&#x27;ve asked for right away.

Since we are a small team, we are not always able to act quickly on the feedback we receive. We take care to thoroughly discuss feedback and figure out the best next steps to take. This sometimes includes the decision to <em>not</em> act on the feedback we receive, because it is outside of what our current resources allow.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="recurring-survey"><a href="#recurring-survey">Recurring Survey</a><a href="#recurring-survey" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to recurring-survey" title="Direct link to recurring-survey">​</a></h3><p>You will fill out a survey when you turn in your independent project.
