While it's vital to learn how to code if you want to be a software developer, finding your first job can be a challenge. Over the years, we've identified processes and behaviors that tend to make the difference between a graduate being successful or not. To this end, alongside the coding curriculum you'll be going through during the program, there is also a career services curriculum. The same expectations and deadlines will apply to both types of assignments. 

Your advisor will send out an email with the specific dates when different pieces of the career services curriculum will occur, but here is a broad overview of what you can expect. 

**Week 7: LinkedIn Profile**
You will have time in class to create or update your LinkedIn profile to set you up for success in the tech industry. 

**Weeks 8-10: LinkedIn Profile Reviews**
You'll meet with your cohort's advisor to go over your LinkedIn profile. 

**Week 16: Resume and Cover Letter Day in Class**
You will have a day of in-class time this week dedicated to writing a cover letter and resume, cleaning up your GitHub portfolio, and practicing interview questions. 

**Weeks 17-19: Resume and Cover Letter Reviews**
Much like your LinkedIn profile, your advisor will meet with you to go over your resume and cover letter. 

**Weeks 21-23: Mock Interview**
Sometime during this period, you will be scheduled for your first mock interview. This will include both technical and non-technical questions, and will be a great opportunity to sharpen your interview skills before your internship interviews with actual companies. 

**Week 24 and Week 26: Internship Applications**
In each week you will have one days in-class time to start researching and reaching out to companies for an internship. This may look like applying to already existing internship positions within a company or reaching out to companies to see if they are interested in taking on a junior developer.

Before all this, your cohort's advisor will discuss in more detail with the class what to expect and how to prepare.

**Week 29: Indeed Resume**
You will have time in class to create an Indeed profile and resume. 

**Week 31: Job Applications 1**
This will be the first week where you will have time to apply for jobs in class. During class, you will write cover letters, customize your resume, and apply for 2 jobs. Your advisor will be available to help you send out the best possible material! 

**Week 31-32: Second Mock Interview**
During these weeks, there will be a second round of mock interviews to help everyone get ready for internships and their job hunt. 

**Week 33: Job Applications 2**
Now that you have had some practice, applying for jobs should come a little bit easier. Again, you'll have time in class to apply for jobs. By the end of the class, you will submit 3 job applications. 

**Week 35: Job Applications 3**
You will have time in class and apply for 2 new jobs before the end of the week.

**Week 38: Job Applications 4 and Planning Your Time After Epicodus**
You'll apply for 1 new job during class this week and go through job search strategies with your advisor.

You'll continue to receive job searching support for up to a year after graduation. We look forward to helping your successful entry into the tech industry!
