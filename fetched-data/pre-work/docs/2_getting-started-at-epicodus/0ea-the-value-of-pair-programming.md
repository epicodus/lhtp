In the last lesson, we discussed pair programming, including why it's part of what we do at Epicodus and some of the benefits (and challenges) that come with programming with others.

We recognize that pair programming can be particularly challenging for any number of reasons. For instance, some people may be introverts or deal with anxiety. Others may feel like they are more productive when they work alone. And many are nervous because pair programming is different from how they've worked with others before.

In the following one-minute video, Daniel Hongel, a former student at Epicodus and a current Epicodus Instructor for the FIDGETECH program, describes his experience pair programming.
