Welcome to Intro to Programming! You are taking your first steps on the journey to becoming a developer, and we couldn't be more excited to have you on the road with us!

## [Getting Started at Epicodus](#getting-started-at-epicodus)

---

If you haven't already reviewed the content from the _Getting Started at Epicodus_ section before this one, please do so now. Lessons in that section outline general recommendations, expectations and protocol for all Epicodus students and courses.

## [Your Intro to Programming Course](#your-intro-to-programming-course)

---

Each course section of Intro to Programming will cover new concepts and tools considered to be fundamental to all programming languages we teach. In addition to learning new skills, you'll also learn a whole new technical vocabulary as well, as we introduce new terminology at every turn.

However, please note **you are not required to memorize code or vocabulary as you work through lessons.** Instead, daily practice will reinforce the concepts and skills you need to be successful. Like learning to play piano, it's your hands on the keys every day, over and over, that will make all the difference in what you know and how you play.

## [Pre-Class Homework](#pre-class-homework)

---

Before arriving for your first day of class, work through all lessons in this section. They'll cover using something called a **command line** and a piece of software we'll use in every class called **Visual Studio Code**. (Don't worry, lessons after this one will explain more!)

Oh, and don't forget to bring your questions, ideas, curiosity, and enthusiasm to class! The adventure begins... we're so happy you're here!
