Remote learning comes up with its own set of challenges. These challenges can be even more pronounced for parents taking care of children, people with disabilities, and more. We are dedicated to making our online program accessible to all. Please reach out to your instructor or to career services staff if you have questions about accommodations or accessibility.

**If you are a parent taking care of a child while taking the program remotely,** we know it can be a challenge to do both at the same time! Accommodations are available including extended breaks and partial flex time. While we expect students to pair between 8-5, some allowances can be made if flexibility is needed for childcare. Please let an instructor know your individual situation and we will work with you on a plan. You might also find some interesting tips in this article about [working remotely with kids](https://open.buffer.com/integrating-work-family-21-tips-working-home-kids/).

**If you are an English language learner and want to translate between languages,** we suggest installing a browser extension to make translation quick and easy. Because we use the Chrome browser in our lessons, we recommend the [Google Translate browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb?hl=en). 

**If you are deaf or hard of hearing,** Discord text channels are available for communication instead of using voice channels. Also, Skype and Google Hangouts provide real-time (though not completely accurate) captions for video calls, which can be used for Scrum meetings and Career Services Info Sessions. If you need accommodations, reach out to your instructor or advisor to ensure that remote meetings are captioned. 

**If you have a visual or reading impairment, or simply prefer to listen instead of read,** Discord has a Text-To-Speech feature that [you can read about and learn how to implement here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/212517297-Text-to-Speech-101). You can also try out the [Natural Reader Text to Speech Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/natural-reader-text-to-sp/kohfgcgbkjodfcfkcackpagifgbcmimk?hl=en), though it's worth noting that many features are behind a paywall.

**If you do not have access to high-speed internet or to a more recent computer,** it may cause some challenges for you. However, we understand that not everyone can afford a new computer and more expensive internet. While we cannot provide computers, we can try to work with you to troubleshoot your individual situation and provide accommodations as needed. Please reach out to your instructor for more information.

**If you need other accommodations,** please reach out to your instructor and career services staff.
