We hope you're as excited about the first day of class as we are! To make sure you start class smoothly, **please make sure you install the necessary software for the first two courses on your personal machine before beginning class.** This way, you can ensure you will be able to complete Epicodus coursework at home on your own machine.

You will have the opportunity to get setup assistance from Epicodus staff. For in-person students, usually instructors set up a specific time and day to address set up issues. For online students, instructors typically meet with students on an as-needed basis. **If you need setup assistance, let your instructor know as soon as possible.** Please know that the assistance we can provide is limited and that we do not have the staffing to debug complex personal environment issues.

Epicodus uses Macs and the Chrome browser. In general, Mac and Windows users with a recent OS should not have issues installing any of the software.

We don't have the staffing to offer setup support for Linux distributions at this time. However, many students have completed the program successfully using Linux.

Regardless of whether you have Windows, Mac, or another OS â€” or whether your machine is newer or older, it's important to have your machine's environment set up ahead of time.
