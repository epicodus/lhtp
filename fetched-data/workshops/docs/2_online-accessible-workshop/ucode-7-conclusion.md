## Thank You!

We hope you've had fun building a web application with us.

If you'd like to continue learning, there are great resources all around the internet. We're proud of the work our staff has done on our expansive, free curriculum at [learnhowtoprogram.com](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming). We hope you try a few more exercises or work to expand your knowledge there.

If you've enjoyed your time in our classroom we invite to apply to either our part-time or full-time courses at Epicodus.
