## Thank You!

We hope you've had fun building a web application with us.

If you'd like to continue learning, there are great resources all around the internet. We're proud of the work our staff has done on our expansive, free curriculum at [learnhowtoprogram.com](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming). We hope you try a few more exercises or work to expand your knowledge there.

If you've enjoyed your time in our classroom we invite to apply to either our part-time or full-time courses at Epicodus. We teach classes in [Seattle](https://www.epicodus.com/seattle/) and [Portland](https://www.epicodus.com/portland/), have industry leading [career services](https://www.epicodus.com/career-services/) for graduates, and are proud winners of multiple [national bootcamp awards](https://www.epicodus.com/blog/epicodus-wins-industry-awards-and-badges).

Visit our website at [epicodus.com](http://www.epicodus.com/) or chat with the staff members here at the workshop to learn more.
