Welcome to your third day of Epicodus! Maybe it feels like it's already been a long week — or maybe you feel like you're starting to get in the swing of things. Or maybe you're feeling a bit of both. That's normal — you're learning a lot of new material at once and it takes getting used to.

Here is today's schedule and expectations.

## Schedule

---

Once again, **times are approximate**. Always follow your instructor's direction as far as the scheduling of activities at Epicodus. If you have any questions about the schedule, check in with your instructor.

**8:00 – 8:30: Dev Team Scrum**

The first thing you should do during your Dev Team Scrum is sign in to the Epicodus attendance system. You should also remind your fellow dev team members to do this as well so that no one forgets!

Next, make sure that everyone is present for the Dev Team Scrum: 

- If you are an online student, this includes conducting a connectivity debugging session. Is everyone able to access the voice channel in Discord? If not, take a few minutes to make sure everyone is taking part. Remember, if you have recurring issues, reach out to an instructor. When everyone is connected, you can start your brief group check-in.
- If you are studying in person, take the time to make sure that everyone who is in your dev team and present for class is together before start your brief group check-in.

As a reminder, **Dev Team Scrum** includes a brief group check-in to talk about anything that came up during the last class session — such as things you've learned or things that you find exciting or frustrating. This is also a great time to ask each other questions about any content that you might find confusing. As covered in the lesson about [working with a dev team](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/pre-work/getting-started-with-intro-to-programming/working-with-a-dev-team), in about 15 minutes, each student in the dev team should answer these 3 questions:

* What did you work on in the last class session or over the weekend?
* What are you working on today?
* What blocks do you have? What is standing in your way?

Once everyone has had a chance to speak, the next step is to find a pair from within your Dev Team and then begin pair programming. If there is an odd number of people in your dev team, there will be one group of three. 

**8:30 – 9:00: Cohort Scrum**

Your Cohort Scrum meeting is an instructor-led Scrum with your entire cohort. This is the usual Scrum that you'll take part in every day for the rest of the program, and it varies in length depending on what there is to cover. It's a great time to ask questions and go over key concepts.

**9:00 – 12:00: Pair Programming** 

**12:00 – 1:00: Lunch**

**1:00 – 4:30: Pair Programming**

**4:30 – 5:00: Dev Team Retrospective**

Starting today, every day at the end of class you will meet with your dev team to discuss how the day went. We call this meeting a "retrospective". While companies usually don't have _daily_ retrospectives, this is a good practice for students to maximize learning and share work. It's also a great time to get to know your cohort peers.

Here are potential topics to cover in the retrospective:

* Show and tell: what did you create today? Share your screen and walkthrough your code.
* What did you enjoy the most?
* What is a bug you fixed? Share your screen and give a walkthrough.
* What did you struggle with?
* Share tips and resources you found useful.
* Give shout-outs to anyone in your group who has helped you or that you appreciate in general.
* Discuss what you want to do better tomorrow.

## Third Day Expectations

---

Today we'll learn key HTML and CSS concepts.

* Styling with classes
* Divs and spans
* Using floats
* Box model

For Friday's project, you will be expected to use styling with HTML classes, incorporate floats and the box model, and use both divs and spans. It may sound like a lot but don't worry — these are basic elements of HTML.

Finally, there are two homework lessons tonight about preparing for the upcoming independent project. Make sure to bring any questions that come up to your teacher.

**Take note:** on short weeks, daily expectations change, and you may cover more or less content on a given class day.
