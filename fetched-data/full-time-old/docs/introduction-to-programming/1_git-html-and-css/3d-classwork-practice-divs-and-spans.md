**Goal**: Practice using the the tags we learned in the previous lesson:

* `<div>` tags — places to add classes to large parts of our page and separate out content
* `<span>` tags — places to add classes to content within block elements

And practice using the CSS sizing units we learned in the previous lesson:

* `px`
* `%`
* `vh` and `vw`

## Warm Up
<hr />

* What is the difference between a `div` and a `span`?
* When would you use a `span` but _not_ a `div`?
* When would you use a `div` but _not_ a `span`?
* Between `px` and `%`, which sizing unit will cause an element to change size in relation to its parent element? 

## Code
<hr />

Meet the goal by completing one of these projects. Make sure to make commits regularly and push to the project's remote repository on GitHub.

### Boring Lecture

* Rewrite the `boring-lecture` page and remove the `intro` class from the elements themselves, and create a `<div>` with the `intro` class to hold the elements.
* Use two sizing units of your choice to size two or more HTML elements.

### Blogging Site

* Create a new blogging website about whatever you want and use `<div>`s to group together and style each blog post.
* On the blogging website, create an "about me" section that's styled differently from the rest of the page.
* Use two sizing units of your choice to size two or more HTML elements.

### Resume Site
