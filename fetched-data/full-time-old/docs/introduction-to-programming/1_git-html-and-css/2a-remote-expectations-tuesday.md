Welcome to your second day of Epicodus! Hopefully your first day went well — but it's also completely normal if you had to deal with frustrations such as connectivity issues, figuring out how to work with a pair, finding your dev team, and coding issues that may have come up throughout the day. Fortunately, we'll be building on yesterday's concepts further today.

Here is today's schedule and expectations.

## Schedule

---

Once again, **keep in mind that times are approximate.** For example, your Cohort Scrum meeting with your instructor may start late or vary in length.

**8:00: Join Dev Team**

At the start of class, you'll join your dev team. You'll have the same dev team for the entire course section. If you are having any issues with members of your dev team, please reach out to an instructor.

**8:05-8:15: Make Sure Everyone Is Present for Dev Team Scrum**

If you are an online student, we'll start with a connectivity debugging session. Is everyone able to access the voice channel in Discord? If not, take a few minutes to make sure everyone is taking part. If this was a rough process yesterday, hopefully it will be smoother today. However, if you have recurring issues, we recommend reaching out to an instructor. Whenever everyone is connected, you can start your Dev Team Scrum.

If you are studying in person, take the time to make sure that everyone who is in your dev team and present for class is together before starting your Dev Team Scrum.

**8:00 – 8:30: Dev Team Scrum**

Today there won't be any icebreakers. Instead, you'll follow the everyday process for Dev Team Scrum, which we'll review now. 

You'll begin every class day with a meeting with your dev team. We call this meeting "Dev Team Scrum". Note that you'll have the same dev team for the entire course section (which lasts a week or two). If you are having any issues with members of your dev team, please reach out to an instructor.

The first thing you should do during your Dev Team Scrum is sign in to the Epicodus attendance system. You should also remind your fellow dev team members to do this as well so that no one forgets!

Next, make sure that everyone is present for the Dev Team Scrum: 

- If you are an online student, this includes conducting a connectivity debugging session. Is everyone able to access the voice channel in Discord? If not, take a few minutes to make sure everyone is taking part. Remember, if you have recurring issues, reach out to an instructor. When everyone is connected, you can start your brief group check-in.
- If you are studying in person, take the time to make sure that everyone who is in your dev team and present for class is together before start your brief group check-in.

As a reminder, **Dev Team Scrum** includes a brief group check-in to talk about anything that came up during the last class session — such as things you've learned or things that you find exciting or frustrating. This is also a great time to ask each other questions about any content that you might find confusing. As covered in the lesson about [working with a dev team](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/pre-work/getting-started-with-intro-to-programming/working-with-a-dev-team), in about 15 minutes, each student in the dev team should answer these 3 questions:

* What did you work on in the last class session or over the weekend?
* What are you working on today?
* What blocks do you have? What is standing in your way?

Once everyone has had a chance to speak, the next step is to find a pair from within your Dev Team and then begin pair programming. If there is an odd number of people in your dev team, there will be one group of three. 

**8:30 – 9:00: Cohort Scrum**

Cohort Scrum is a time for your teachers to make announcements, cover certain topics from the curriculum, and for you to ask questions. These Scrums can vary in length from taking five minutes to the whole half hour, depending on what needs to be discussed. Instructor-led Scrum meetings happen in a Google Meet or in person. If you are having any problems accessing the meeting, reach out to an instructor.

**9:00 – 12:00: Morning Pair Programming** 

**12:00 – 1:00: Lunch**

**1:00 – 4:30: Pair Programming**

**4:30 – 5:00: Career Services Info Session**

Career service staff will talk with students about expectations related to Epicodus' career services.

## Second Day Expectations

---

Today we'll continue building on yesterday's concepts and learn some new ones as well.

* HTML inline elements
* CSS Styling
* Debugging HTML and CSS
* Git branching and merging
* Markdown
* Deploying to GitHub Pages
* Writing READMEs

For the independent project, you will be required to add a CSS stylesheet, include a README that uses Markdown, and deploy your site to GitHub pages.

Finally, there are two homework lessons tonight on Journaling at Epicodus. You are not required to keep a journal while at Epicodus but we recommend keeping one as a tool for reflection and to see your progress throughout the program. In future weeks, the journal prompt will be in the weekend homework. You'll then have an opportunity to discuss the journal prompt with your pair on Sunday morning.

**Take note:** on short weeks, daily expectations change, and you may cover more or less content on a given class day.
