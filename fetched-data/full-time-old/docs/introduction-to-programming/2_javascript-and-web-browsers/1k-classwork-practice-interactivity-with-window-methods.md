**Goal:**  In the "Interactivity with Window Methods" lesson, we learned:

* `window` methods perform actions in the browser.
* Examples of `window` methods include `window.alert()`, `window.prompt()`, and `window.confirm()`.
* JavaScript methods can be chained onto `window` methods.

Methods are an important part of programming, and you'll be using them constantly. Get the hang of calling `window` methods by completing the practice exercises listed below.

## Warm Up
<hr />

* How can we comment out code?
* What happens when we run code that is commented out?
* What are the differences between the `window.alert()`, `window.confirm()`, and `window.prompt()` methods?
* What is data type coercion?

## Code

### `window` Methods Practice

Practice using these `window` methods:

* Use `window.alert()` to pop up a dialog box with a warning for the user.
* Use `window.confirm()` to ask a yes or no question.
* Use `window.prompt()` to ask a question.
* Save the response to the `window.prompt()` as a variable. All responses entered by a user into a prompt input are saved as strings (even if the user enters `10`, the value is saved as the string, `"10"`). Run at least 3 string methods of your choice on the string variable that you create from the prompt.
* Ask the user to enter their age in a prompt, and turn the response into a number using `parseInt()`. First, save the response as a new variable and turn it into a number. Then, try turning the response into a number without saving it into a variable.
