Hi! Welcome to _LearnHowToProgram.com_. This site is a step-by-step guide to take you from zero experience to web programmer in a few short months. Learn How to Program contains both lessons and practice exercises. This content is the curriculum for [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com), a school for people who want to change careers and learn how to code. You are also welcome to go through the site on your own.

All of the curriculum is accessible under the Courses tab. To get started, go to the [pre-work](https://pre-work.learnhowtoprogram.com/).

## [Our Philosophy](#our-philosophy)

---

Before we get started, let's discuss our general philosophy at Epicodus. If you talk to an experienced developer, they'll likely agree that the more you learn about programming, the more you realize just how little you know. It's like pointing a telescope out at the universe. There are more and more stars and galaxies and solar systems the further you go. The same is true with coding.

Being a developer is not about learning a fixed set of skills that you can apply for the rest of your career. A tool you learn today may be replaced by a tool you learn a few years from now. Even if it's not replaced, it will likely be updated and modified, perhaps to the point where it no longer looks like the tool you use today.

That understanding fundamentally shapes how we structure Epicodus. **We believe that the languages, tools, and approaches you'll learn here are much less important than the general skills of solving problems**. Successful programmers embrace the limitations of their knowledge and get good at figuring out what they don't know. They develop a mindset in which _not knowing_ the answer isn't a source of anxiety, but rather an opportunity to learn and explore.

## [How LearnHowToProgram.com Works](#how-learnhowtoprogram-com-works)

Now let's explore how this site works. When you first navigate to LearnHowToProgram.com, you are taken to the "Introduction to Programming" course at Epicodus. We have multiple courses here and we bundle them into a track. This track includes an Introduction to Programming course, an Intermediate JavaScript course, a React course, and a course on C# and .NET. The curriculum for all of our tracks is listed on [learnhowtoprogram.com/courses](/courses), and more information about taking coursework at Epicodus can be found on [epicodus.com/what-to-expect](https://www.epicodus.com/what-to-expect). 

Our "Introduction To Programming" course is designed to take you from zero experience to being able to create the content of basic web pages, style those pages so that they look nice, and add basic interactivity. This course also covers how to use the common tools of the programming trade including the command line and source control.

Once you've completed the first section, you will be ready to dive into a programming language. You will first take two classes on JavaScript, including Introduction to Programming and Intermediate JavaScript. JavaScript is the only programming language that web browsers understand. HTML and CSS are markup and styling languages respectively, not programming languages — so even though browsers understand them they are a little different.

If we want to work with ye olde interwebs (the internet) - and we most certainly do if we are interested in web development - then we need to know at least some JavaScript. If you're more interested in front-end work, JavaScript will let you build out interactivity in your web pages. If you're more interested in back-end work (such as working with databases), JavaScript will let you wire up user interfaces to work with servers and databases. JavaScript can be used for back-end code, too.

After JavaScript, you'll learn C#/.NET. Don't get too hung up on picking the "right" language and framework, though. Odds are, at your first job, you'll need to learn an entirely new set of skills and practices and maybe even a new programming language. That's part of why we require all students to study at least two languages — with two under your belt, it's not too difficult to pick up a third.

No matter what languages and framework you learn, our best advice is not to think of Epicodus as a place to learn a specific language. Instead, think of Epicodus as a place to _learn how to learn_.

## [Are You Starting Classes at Epicodus?](#are-you-starting-classes-at-epicodus)

Wonderful! We're glad to have you with us. Every student beginning class at Epicodus has **pre-work** to do. This pre-work can take some time and we suggest budgeting about half a day to work through it all. There is software installation and set up to complete, as well as lessons to read through that will orient you to the flow of daily and weekly classwork, important policies, what to expect, and more! Please make sure to work through all of this pre-work before the start of class:

The pre-work includes sections on _Getting Started at Epicodus_, _Getting Started with Working Remotely_, and _Getting Started with Intro to Programming_. You can access the pre-work [here](https://pre-work.learnhowtoprogram.com/).

Okay, let's get going!
