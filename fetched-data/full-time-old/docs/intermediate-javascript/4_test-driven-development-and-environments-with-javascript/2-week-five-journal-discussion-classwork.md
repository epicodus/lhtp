As discussed in the _[Journaling at Epicodus](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-journaling-at-epicodus)_ lesson, each weekend you'll receive a journaling assignment in addition to your coding homework. You'll then discuss your responses with a partner at the beginning of the next class session.

## Journal Response Discussion

### This Section's Prompt

As you'll recall, you were asked to write responses to the following in your journal over the weekend, as detailed in the Journal #5 prompt:

> * Jot down brief examples and stories of times you've demonstrated aptitude in the following areas. These examples _don't_ have to be related to coding or Epicodus.
>  * Problem solving, both technical and not.
>  * Time management, especially when under multiple deadlines.
>  * Team collaboration and communication.
>  * Leadership.
>  * Fostering and contributing toward an inclusive, productive environment.
>  * Setting and meeting goals.
>  * Tackling tough problems or tasks, learning and researching as you go.
>
> * Along these same lines, think about other jobs and work you've done. How do they relate to the coding work you've done here at Epicodus, even if they're non-technical in nature?

### Discussion Questions

Before beginning programming work, discuss what you recorded in your journal with your partner using the following questions as a guide:

* Discuss what field each partner used to work in; whether past jobs and career industries, focuses and majors at previous educational programs, etc. Brainstorm together how skills require for those jobs, industries, and studies apply to coding. Is there anything your partner came up with that you didn't previously consider? Jot it down!

* Share the examples you recorded for the prompt above. Workshop them with your partner; are they good examples you feel would work well in an interview? Why or why not? (It's alright if you don't have much/any professional interviewing experience to draw upon, just share your honest opinion!)
