Congratulations! You've made it through Epicodus's classwork! That's _twenty weeks_ for our full-time students and _forty weeks_ for our part-time students. We applaud your hard work!

## Independent Capstone Project Objectives
---

* Did you participate in capstone project process, including submitting proposal, working effectively throughout the course section, and presenting at the trade show?
* Did you put in at least 40 hours of work towards your capstone project? (The 40 hours corresponds to the amount of dedicated class time for you to work on your capstone that we structure into the program.)
