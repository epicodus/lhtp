Welcome to C#/.NET.

The C# ("C sharp") programming language is most commonly used with the .NET framework. Students who are well-versed in C# programming can use it to create client applications, database applications, distributed components, and much more.

Students who prefer the C# programming and .NET framework part of this program might consider targeting larger enterprises, government agencies, and companies serving enterprise and government clients for employment. 

Companies using C# and .NET who have hired Epicodus graduates include New Relic, Salesforce, and Eyecue Labs.

* C# Basics: Syntax differences, and strongly typed languages
