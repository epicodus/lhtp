Writing your resume is a very similar process to writing the cover letter — we want to use many of the same keywords from the job description, and tie them to our experience.

This time, though, we'll include a more complete work and education history, and write using bullet points instead of paragraphs. Use specific numbers and accomplishments, like _"Consistently in the top 10% of representatives for customer satisfaction"_, rather than generic phrases, like _"Achieved customer satisfaction"_. We'll keep the information on it concise, specific, and relevant to the position.

You may also find that some aspects of your experience aren't as relevant to some jobs; feel free to leave things out to keep the resume focused on what the company you're applying with wants. A great resume is tailored to each individual job posting.

Here's what the resume might look like:

(As with the cover letter, **do not copy this example resume** — it will be very obvious to Epicodus staff and to employers if you do, especially if your resume looks suspiciously like other students who ignore this warning and copy it.)

And here's our master list of experiences from before, crossed out as we included them in the resume:

Make sure your resume is visually appealing — unless you're applying for a design-related job, don't spend too much time on the layout, but make sure that it's formatted cleanly and consistently. For example, don't use bullets in one place and letters in another.

Put your name, phone, and email at the top of the resume. Optionally, you can include your mailing address, Github profile, and LinkedIn profile.

Most people's resumes should be under a page. If you have extensive relevant career experience, it's okay to be a bit longer.

With that, we're done! This cover letter and resume will get us past any bots or even non-technical HR staff by using the terms and phrases from the job description. It will also make it easy for a hiring manager to see that we have the skills and attitudes they're looking for in this role.

**One last tip**: when applying for a job by email, put your cover letter in the body of your email, and attach it and your resume as a PDF (not as a Word document).
