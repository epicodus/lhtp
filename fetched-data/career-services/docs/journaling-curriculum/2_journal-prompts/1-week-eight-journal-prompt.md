You were asked to keep a journal while going through the program. Each weekend you'll receive a brief journaling assignment in addition to your coding homework. (Review the _[Journaling at Epicodus](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-journaling-at-epicodus)_ lesson for a refresher.)

## Journal #8 Prompt

_Spend several moments thinking critically about the following questions, and record brief yet honest responses. Include a date or timestamp and a brief summary of the prompt to refer back to later._

You just wrapped up your first group project! Group projects are important for a number of reasons; a larger-scope project adds to our growing portfolios, it's an opportunity to practice the Git and GitHub workflow used on larger professional teams and, perhaps most importantly, they allow us to learn and experiment with the collaboration, communication, planning, and organization required to work on a development team--an undeniably necessary skill for any web developer's career.

Because these types of projects and the skills they practice are so important, let's  further reflect upon our experience. Record answers to the following in your journal:   

* What were your most notable _non-technical_ discoveries during this exercise? Whether about yourself, group communication, working with others, or something else?

* What were your greatest strengths? What about your biggest areas for improvement?

* Identify what you can do in the next six sections to further develop any areas for improvement before the next group project.

* Overall, what would you do differently next time? Is there a lesson to be learned and brought with you to your pairing or next group work experience?  

## Discussion

We'll briefly discuss our journal responses to these questions with partners in class. Make sure your responses are recorded before the start of the section!
