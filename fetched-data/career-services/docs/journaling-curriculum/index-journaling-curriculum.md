Welcome to the Journaling Curriculum Home Page.

Every course section you'll have a brief journaling assignment in addition to your coding homework. You can find all the upcoming journal prompts in this section, and they will periodically appear throughout the curriculum as regularly scheduled content. 

To navigate through the lessons, you can utilize the side bar to find the section, day, and lesson you'd like to peruse. Otherwise, to navigate sequentially, click the `Next` or `Previous` buttons at the bottom of each page.
