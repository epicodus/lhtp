Now that you're ready to apply for jobs, you need to know where to look!

If you have any friends or family who work in tech, you should ask them for advice, introductions and referrals, as personal connections are the best ways to get an in.

But job boards are where you'll find the most job openings. As you look at job posts, don't take "requirements" too seriously: if a company asks for 2 years of experience, they're often open to considering someone with much less if the candidate fits the bill in other ways. And if they're looking for a Python developer but you've done Ruby and JavaScript and can show them that you're capable of picking up Python quickly, it's very possible to get in the door. For that matter, don't limit yourself to only applying to jobs in languages where you are familiar; because there are so many programming languages, most jobs will be in languages you haven't used — yet. And don't limit yourself to developer roles — there are many great opportunities for career paths or even just getting your foot in the door in QA, developer support, project management, etc.

Also, not every job employers are hiring for is posted publicly, and a lot of companies have internal job boards or postings. Look on the employment or career pages of individual tech companies. If they have a senior position posted on a job board, you may find a more junior position on their website.
