* Does it state the position you are applying for?

* Does it use key words and phrases from the job description?

* Does all discussion of your experience include concrete examples?

* Does it close with a short summary of why you are a good fit and thank the company for reviewing your application?

* Is it no longer than one page?

* Does it include your email, phone, LinkedIn, and Github for contact info?

* Is it free from spelling and grammar mistakes?
