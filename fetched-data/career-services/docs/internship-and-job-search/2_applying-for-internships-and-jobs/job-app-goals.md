Your goal for today and going forward is to submit two high-quality job applications per day, and to push code to Github once a day. Hopefully you were able to complete one job application yesterday; today, you're going to try to get two in. As you get practice writing and submitting these, they will get faster to write! Continue to have another student and a staff member check your resume and cover letter before you submit them, until you are regularly hearing that they are good to go without further review. (If there's a job you're especially excited about, you might want to have somebody else review your application materials regardless.)
