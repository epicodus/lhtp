## Independent Projects Overview
---

Project prompts will be available on Epicenter at 8:00 am Friday for full-time students and 8:00 am on Thursday for part-time students. Before you begin your project, make sure to take a moment to review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/pre-work/getting-started-at-epicodus/independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson.

## Test-Driven Development and Environments with JavaScript Project Objectives
---

This code review is focused on creating business logic that is thoroughly tested, so no User Interface will be required. Typically, we want you to follow all testing best practices, which includes committing your code and test once it is passing. However, for this project, we want you to follow a different commit workflow to demonstrate your understanding of the Red, Green, Refactor workflow. For this project, make sure that you:

* Commit each test after you have written it and _before_ writing the corresponding method in your business logic. This is the Red phase.
* Then, write the business logic that corresponds to the test, verify that your test passes, and then commit your code. This is the Green phase.
* Refactor your code base and tests as necessary. 
* At the end of your work session, verify that you have 100% coverage on all tests.

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Business logic has 100% line coverage with Jest.
* Tests are included for each business logic behavior and code is committed after each test passes.
* Project utilizes classes, a feature of ES6.
* Dependencies are managed with npm.
* webpack is used to lint, bundle, and process code.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The prompt's required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.

### What is a polished, portfolio-quality state?
When a project is both polished and in a portfolio-quality state, this means:

* You've reviewed your project and your README prior to submitting it to make sure there are no errors or missing information and you are consistent in your indentation, spacing, and code structure. 
* You are following the best practices and coding conventions we teach.

### What are the baseline project requirements?
All independent coding projects at Epicodus have these baseline requirements:

* A complete and informative README
* The project's commit history demonstrates that the project's required work schedule and hours have been met:
  * 8 hours completed on Friday is required for full-time students
  * 4 hours completed over the weekend is required for part-time students
* Completion of the project based on the prompt _and_ objectives. The prompt contains details on the project's theme and features that are not always detailed in the objective. Carefully read through the prompt towards the end of your work session to make sure that you are not missing anything.
