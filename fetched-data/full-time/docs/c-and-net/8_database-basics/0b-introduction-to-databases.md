Before we begin connecting databases to our MVC apps, let's explore how databases work. This lesson will walk through basic database vocabulary and discuss how most standard databases organize information.

## Database Structure
---

If you've ever used Microsoft Excel or other similar software to create spreadsheets, you already know something about how databases are structured. Databases are like a bunch of linked spreadsheets. Each "spreadsheet" of information is called a **table**.

### Example Databases

Let's make a mock database table that includes names and phone numbers:

<pre>
contacts
-------

 id | name    | phone
 ---+---------+-----------
 1  | Ahmed   | 9165551212
 2  | Jessica | 3235551212
 3  | Sofia   | 4155551212
</pre>

* Just like a spreadsheet, this database **table** has a name. This one is called `contacts`.

* It has three **columns**: `id`, `name` and `phone`.

* It also contains three entries, or **rows**: one for `Ahmed`, one for `Jessica`, and a third for `Sofia`. Each row contains an `id`, `name` and `phone` number corresponding to this person.  

Here's another example. This one contains booleans:

<pre>
things_in_portland
------------------

 id | category     | in_portland
 ---+--------------+------------
 1  | sunshine     | false
 2  | moonshine    | true
 3  | shiny things | true
</pre>

* This **table** is titled `things_in_portland`.

* Its **columns** are `id`, `category`, and `in_portland`.

* It contains three **rows**.

## C# Classes and Database Tables
---

Let's consider another basic example. This time, we'll explore how components of a database will work with logic from our C# applications.

Let's pretend we're organizing a music festival. The festival has multiple music stages and many different artists. We've been asked to create an app that will create a program for the festival by tracking the following information:

* Which **artists** are playing at the festival, including;
  * Their name.
  * How many members their band has.
  * The genre of music they play.
* Which **stages** the festival has, including;
  * The name of the stage.
  * The location of the stage in the festival.
  * The audience capacity at that stage.

Before we consider our database, let's first determine how we'd represent this information in C# code. We should immediately think of two classes for this application:  `Stage` and `Artist`.  To keep it simple, our `Stage` class has three properties: `Name`, `Location`, and `Capacity`. Our `Artist` class also has three properties: `Name`, `Members`, and`Genre`.  

Here are the classes for `Artist` and `Stage`:

<div class="filename">Stage.cs</div>

```csharp
class Stage
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Location { get; set; }
  public int Capacity { get; set; }
}
```

<div class="filename">Artist.cs</div>

```csharp
class Artist
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Members { get; set; }
  public string Genre { get; set; }
}
```

In order to store these objects in a database, our database tables would be structured like this:

**_stages_ table**<br />
![stages table](https://learnhowtoprogram.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/relational-database-concepts/stages-empty.png)<br /><br />

**_artists_ table**<br />
![artists table](https://learnhowtoprogram.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/relational-database-concepts/artists-empty.png)<br /><br />

* The C# class name matches the name of the corresponding database table.

* Each class property is represented with a column on the table.

* Classes in C# are singular and capitalized. However, corresponding database tables are plural and lower case. This is standard naming convention.

### Rows and Columns

When we create new C# objects, we assign each object property a value in the constructor. We do the same when we store data in a database: assign values to each property. In effect, the equivalent of an object in the database is the **row** with each property value being stored in a property **column**.  

#### `stages` Table

![stages table populated](https://learnhowtoprogram.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/relational-database-concepts/stages-populated.png)<br /><br />

#### `artists` Table

![artists table populated](https://learnhowtoprogram.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/relational-database-concepts/artists-populated.png)<br /><br />

Here, each **row** in the database represents a C# `Artist` or `Stage` object. Each of the object's properties is stored under the database column of the same name.

### Primary Keys

When database rows are added, the first column (usually called `id`) is the **primary key**. This is a unique ID for _that specific row_ on _that specific table_. It will never be repeated or reused in the table. Our database will make it for us automatically.

In our example, the `Blue stage` has a primary key of `1` on the `stages` table and `Pink Martini` has a primary key of `3` on the `artists` table. Similar to the manner we used `Id` properties to locate specific objects last section, these primary database keys are used to locate specific database entries.
