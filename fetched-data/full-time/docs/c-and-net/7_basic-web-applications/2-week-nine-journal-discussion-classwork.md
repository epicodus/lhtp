As discussed in the _[Journaling at Epicodus](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-journaling-at-epicodus)_ lesson, each weekend you'll receive a journaling assignment in addition to your coding homework. You'll then discuss your responses with a partner at the beginning of the next class session.

## Journal Response Discussion

### This Section's Prompt

You were asked to write responses to the following in your journal over the weekend, as detailed in the Journal #9 prompt:

> * Review what you wrote about your ideal job in the last section. Do you know what this position might be titled?...
>
> * If you aren't sure what type of real-world position would be similar to your ideal position, that's alright! Simply browse more postings on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs), [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm), and/or [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/l-Portland,-OR-jobs.html) to get an idea.
>
> * Look for more job postings for this same job title (or similar titles) and identify what they have in common, paying especially careful attention to the requirements that aren't directly technical (we'll explore technical qualifications later on)...
>
> * Then...list skills and experience you already have that demonstrate these requirements. Don't hesitate to record anything, or convince yourself anything is "too much of a stretch" or a "long shot". Just get any and all connections you can make down on paper...

### Discussion Questions

Discuss what you recorded in your journal with your partner.

* Talk about what each partner currently thinks their ideal post-graduation job might be. What non-technical requirements, traits and skills are frequently mentioned in these jobs postings?

* Discuss what pre-Epicodus experience you each have that could apply to this type of work.

* Offer feedback on the narrative connections that are beginning to form. For instance, did your partner say they _might_ be interested in project management work? And that they used to work as a wildlands firefighter? Don't you think the high-pressure work environment of firefighting that requires people remain flexible, pivot quickly, and maintain great organization and communication with a team translates to managing a big, high-stakes tech project too? _Hmm..._
