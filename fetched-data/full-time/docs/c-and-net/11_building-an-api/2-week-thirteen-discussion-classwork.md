As discussed in the _[Journaling at Epicodus](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-journaling-at-epicodus)_ lesson, each weekend you'll receive a journaling assignment in addition to your coding homework. You'll then discuss your responses with a partner at the beginning of the next class session.

## Journal Response Discussion
---

### This section's Prompt

You were asked to write responses to the following in your journal over the weekend, as detailed in the Journal #13 prompt:

> * Revisit your journal response from last section. What did you identify as your three core values? Jot them down again.

> * In past journal prompts, we explored how past work and education experiences relate to our career goals, even if those past experiences weren't related to coding. How were your core values relevant and evident in those experiences?

> * Then reflect on your current experience at Epicodus. How have your core values influenced it? (Did your value of _Ambition_ lead you to enroll? Or perhaps your value of _Resourcefulness_ has made you a super efficient problem solver?)

> * Next, refer to your response from the section nine journal prompt. In that prompt, we began identifying the type of work we may seek after graduation. Are these goals still accurate? If not, update them. Then record how your values relate to these goals too.

> * Finally, weave your responses to the previous three questions into a couple brief sentences that depict how your values have informed past experiences, present time at Epicodus, and future career goals.

### Discussion Questions

Discuss what you recorded in your journal with your partner.

* Share the brief "summary" of your personal narrative you created in this section's journal response with your partner.

* Give feedback on each partner's beginning narrative. Is the connection between the values and past/present/future experiences clear, or unclear? Is there a way it could be tweaked to better represent this person's story?
