You were asked to keep a journal while going through the program. Each weekend you'll receive a brief journaling assignment in addition to your coding homework. (Review the _[Journaling at Epicodus](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-journaling-at-epicodus)_ lesson for a refresher.)

## Journal #15 Prompt

_Think critically about the following questions, and record brief yet honest responses. Include a date or timestamp and quick summary of the prompt to refer to later._

As you advance through your final course, these last few journal prompts will focus on the job and internship interview/search process to prepare for your (quickly approaching!) career after graduation. One common piece of interview advice is to enter the interview with a game plan. Specifically, a mental list of things you want to bring up in the interview.

* What are three things about you that you wouldn't want to leave an interview without the interviewer knowing? These can be anything, but we recommend not selecting _only_ technical skills. Teams are looking for great culture fits, too!

* If you're having trouble deciding, think about it this way: What traits, qualities, skills, hobbies, experiences, education, etc. do you have that may both set you apart from other candidates, and prove interesting and/or beneficial to the interviewer and team?

* How do these relate to your personal narrative. Or, if they don't, do you think they should be included in that narrative?

* What can you do to ensure these traits and qualities aren't missed? Come up with a (very flexible!) plan for how you might include this information in the natural flow of the interview. Do you mention them in your answer to that ubiquitous _"So, tell me about yourself?"_ question? Do you anticipate being able to mention your history of volunteer work when discussing previous work experience? Obviously there's no surefire way to anticipate _exactly_ what each interview will be like, but it's helpful to brainstorm how you'll fit these things in.
