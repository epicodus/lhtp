As discussed in the _[Journaling at Epicodus](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-journaling-at-epicodus)_ lesson, each weekend you'll receive a journaling assignment in addition to your coding homework. You'll then discuss your responses with a partner at the beginning of the next class session.

## Journal Response Discussion
---

### This section's Prompt

You were asked to write responses to the following in your journal over the weekend, as detailed in the Journal #15 prompt:

> * What are three things about you that you wouldn't want to leave an interview without the interviewer knowing? These can be anything, but we recommend not selecting _only_ technical skills. Teams are looking for great culture fits, too!

> * If you're having trouble deciding, think about it this way: What traits, qualities, skills, hobbies, experiences, education, etc. do you have that may both set you apart from other candidates, and prove interesting and/or beneficial to the interviewer and team?

> * How do these relate to your personal narrative. Or, if they don't, do you think they should be included in that narrative?

> * What can you do to ensure these traits and qualities aren't missed? Come up with a (very flexible!) plan for how you might include this information in the natural flow of the interview.

### Discussion Questions

Discuss what you recorded in your journal with your partner.

* Share what each partner recorded as the three things they want to make sure to mention in an interview. Give feedback.

* Then, even if it's not directly related to your three things, discuss that all-too-common, super open-ended _"So, tell me about yourself?"_ question with your partner. What will you say, when asked in an interview? How will it relate to your personal narrative? Practice with your pair. Give feedback.
