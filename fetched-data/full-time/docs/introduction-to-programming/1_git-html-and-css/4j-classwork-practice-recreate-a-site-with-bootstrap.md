**Goal**: Practice everything we've learned so far by re-creating a real website using block and inline HTML elements, custom CSS, and Bootstrap.  Keep an eye out for correct indentation, and descriptive Git commit messages in the correct tense.  

## Warm Up
<hr />

* What is the difference between a CSS class and id? When do we use one over another?
* How do we ensure our stylesheet takes precedence over Bootstrap's? Where does this occur?

## Code
<hr />

### Wikipedia Rebuild

Now let's use Bootstrap to rebuild the [Wikipedia homepage](https://en.wikipedia.org). Use divs, spans, classes, floats, etc to style the page exactly as it appears in your browser. Feel free to use placeholder text and images in your project.

**The goal of this exercise is to rebuild how the site _looks_ not how it behaves**, so your links don't need to link anywhere. To make a dummy link, use the `#` as the value of the `href` attribute on your link. For example: `<a href=”#”>`.

A secondary goal is to take the time to explore Bootstrap documentation and implement a new tool that we did not explicitly go over in class. For example, you might explore how to use [nav tabs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/navs-tabs/) or learn how to make [a vertical navigation menu](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/navs-tabs/#vertical). Or, you might learn how to create [a grid with Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/grid/) and [how to align content within the grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/columns/).

Make sure you are committing your changes appropriately and pushing to a remote repository on GitHub. Don’t rush through this. Being able to accurately rebuild a site is a great skill to have and will really help in understanding how CSS works to style your pages.

Finally, include a detailed README with author names, project name, a description, setup instructions, and copyright information.

### Further Exploration

* If you finish early, go back to projects you worked on previously this section and add in Bootstrap. Try implementing other new elements we _haven't_ explicitly covered here in our curriculum.

## Peer Code Review
<hr />

* Does the site utilize divs, spans, floats, etc.?
* Are styles applied with ids and classes? Are each used correctly? 
* Are Bootstrap classes used to style the page?
* Is the code indented properly throughout?
* Are commits made regularly with clear, descriptive messages that complete the phrase "It will..."?
* Is there a complete README?
