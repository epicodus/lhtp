## Independent Projects Overview
---

Project prompts will be published on Epicenter at 8:00 am Friday for full-time students and 8:00 am on Thursday for part-time students. Before the prompt is published, only the objectives will be visible (the same that are listed below).

Before you begin your project, make sure to take a moment to review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/pre-work/getting-started-at-epicodus/independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson. This lesson details:

* Independent project deadlines
* How to submit your code
* How feedback works
* Course completion requirements

## Accessing the Project Prompt
---

To access your independent project prompt, follow these steps:

*  Login to [Epicenter](https://epicenter.epicodus.com). You should automatically be taken to the _Courses_ page, but if not, select _Courses_ from the navigation bar at the top of the page.
* Select your current course from the _Your courses_ section.
* On your course page, select this section's code review from the _Code reviews_ section.
* This will bring you to a code review detail page with:
  * The prompt theme and requirements
  * A list of objectives
  * A list of optional further exploration objectives
  * A location to submit your project
  * A survey to fill out about how the section and project went
  * A location to leave a submission note for your teacher to read 
* Once you've completed your project, submit the GitHub repository containing your project in the  _Submission_ section of the code review detail page. See below for detailed instructions and a review of deadlines.

## JavaScript & Web Browsers Project Objectives
---

This section's independent project will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Form gathers input from the user.
* Branching is used to determine the result.
* Web API object properties or methods (not including `window` methods for alerting, prompting, or confirming) are used to display the result to the user.
* Event handler properties or event listeners are used to handle events. 
* When the user submits the form again (for a second or third time) previous results are hidden, cleared, or replaced.
* Variable names are descriptive of what they represent and use lower camel case (e.g. `myVariableExample`).
* Web page is styled using custom CSS.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The prompt's required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.

### What is a polished, portfolio-quality state?
When a project is both polished and in a portfolio-quality state, this means:

* You've reviewed your project and your README prior to submitting it to make sure there are no errors or missing information and you are consistent in your indentation, spacing, and code structure. 
* You are following the best practices and coding conventions we teach. Make sure that your:
  * Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indentation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
  * Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It will…".

### What are the baseline project requirements?
All independent coding projects at Epicodus have these baseline requirements:

* A complete and informative README
  * It is _not_ required to include a link to your site hosted on gh-pages, but you are welcome and encouraged to do so!
* The project's commit history demonstrates that the project's required work schedule and hours have been met:
  * 8 hours completed on Friday is required for full-time students
  * 4 hours completed over the weekend is required for part-time students
* Completion of the project based on the prompt _and_ objectives. The prompt contains details on the project's theme and features that are not always detailed in the objective. Carefully read through the prompt towards the end of your work session to make sure that you are not missing anything.

## Submission
<hr />

Once you've completed your project, submit your code for review to the **JavaScript and Web Browsers** code review on [Epicenter](https://epicenter.epicodus.com/):

* Navigate to the code review detail page on Epicenter: 
  * Go to the _Courses_ tab,
  * Select _Intro_ under the _Your courses_ section,
  * Select the code review title corresponding to the section under the _Code reviews_ section,
* Once on the code review detail page, scroll down to the _Submission_ section and follow these steps:
  * Input the GitHub repository URL containing your project into the _Submission link_ input.
  * Add a submission note for your teacher to review
  * Complete the survey
  * Confirm that you "have read and understand the guidelines for Independent Projects" by checking the checkbox. 
  * Hit the submit button — you will be taken to a confirmation page.
  * On the submission confirmation page, select whether or not you want to request a meeting with your teacher

### Deadlines
The deadlines for the initial submission are:

  * Friday at 5:00 pm for full-time students.
  * Sunday at 8:00 am for part-time students.

Keep in mind that _resubmission_ deadlines are different!
