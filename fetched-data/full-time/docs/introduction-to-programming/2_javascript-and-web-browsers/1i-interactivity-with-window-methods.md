So far, none of what we've learned lets us interact with users. Let's try out `window` methods that let us do just that!

## Interactivity with `window` Methods
---

We'll continue to use our DevTools console to practice the following `window` methods.

### `window.alert()`

Try running the following code in the DevTools console:

```javascript
> window.alert("Hello world!");
```

When we press enter, the page pops open a dialog box that says "Hello world!"

We should be able to tell that `window.alert()` is a **method**. A method is a function that belongs to an object, and a function is something that performs an action. As we know, methods can take arguments. The `window.alert()` method pops up a dialog box with the string that you pass in as an argument.

### `window.prompt()`

Here's another `window` method that takes a string as an argument:

```javascript
> window.prompt("What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?");  // I'm going to type "African or European?"
"African or European?"
``` 

Remember, in JavaScript everything after the double forward slash `//` is a **comment**. When JavaScript interprets our code, it will ignore these comments. Comments are a convenient way to leave notes in your code for yourself or other programmers. Note, by the way, that the comment comes _after_ the semicolon.

This dialog box lets you type in a response, and then that response is **returned** from the `window.prompt()` method as a string. One cool thing we can do here is set a variable equal to the response, like this:

```javascript
> const favoriteColor = prompt("What is your favorite color?"); // I'm going to type "green"
> favoriteColor;
"green"
```

Here we created a variable named `favoriteColor` and assigned it to hold the string inputted by the user.

Just like we can chain methods to each other in JavaScript, we can also chain JavaScript methods to `window` methods:

```javascript
> window.prompt("Type something in lowercase:").toUpperCase(); // I'm going to type "cat"
"CAT"
```

Remember that browser Web APIs like the `window` object are created to work with JavaScript, so we can perform any JavaScript on these methods. Because `window.prompt()` returns a string, we can chain string methods to `window.prompt()` method calls.

### `window.confirm()`

Another `window` method that allows us to interact with the webpage user is the `window.confirm()` method. This too takes a string as an argument.

```javascript
> confirm("Are you sure?"); // I'm going to press the OK button
true
```

Try it out for yourself in the DevTools console. You should note that `window.confirm()` returns one of two values: `true` or `false`. Notice that there are no quotes around these values. That is because these are **booleans**, not strings. They simply represent being true or false. You initially learned about booleans when you worked with comparison and equality operators.

### Pay Attention to the Data Type that Methods Return

You might have noticed that `window.alert()` returned `undefined`, also without quotes. 

```javascript
> window.alert("Hello world!");
undefined
```

`undefined` simply represents that nothing has been returned from the method (or function), or as you learned previously, that a variable hasn't been assigned a value.

It is good to be conscious of what arguments a method or function takes, and what data type it returns. Here is a table showing that information for the three `window` methods introduced in this lesson:

The `window.alert()` method does not return anything useful, which is fine because we'd only use it to display some information to the user. It's a way to output information, not collect it. 

On the other hand, we'd want to collect the user's response to the `window.prompt()` or `window.confirm()` methods by assigning the returned value to a variable as demonstrated above:

```js
> const favoriteColor = window.prompt("What is your favorite color?");
```

That way we can do something with the inputted information rather than just ignoring it.
