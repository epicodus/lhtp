Welcome to the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion home page.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are core parts of Epicodus's mission statement to "focus on serving people who, by birth or circumstance, don't have easy access to learning the skills they need to get great jobs." When you enroll at Epicodus you are choosing to be a part of that mission. 

Your participation in our DEI mission starts with making our classroom a welcoming and inclusive place for everyone. To that end, we include a DEI curriculum alongside our technical and career services lessons. 

In many weeks, you will have a DEI reading assignment as part of your homework on a topic that is relevant to our school or to the tech industry as a whole. Each reading will end with a reflective writing assignment. The lessons that are contained in this section of Learn How To Program will also appear periodically throughout the other courses and sections, and are part of the regularly scheduled program.

Topics covered by this course are as follows: 

* Making Epicodus an Inclusive Place
* Community Agreements
* Lessons relating to various topics, such as Identifying and Prevent Microaggressions, and associated journal prompts for each topic

To navigate through the lessons, you can utilize the side bar to find the section, day, and lesson you'd like to peruse. Otherwise, to navigate sequentially, click the `Next` or `Previous` buttons at the bottom of each page.
