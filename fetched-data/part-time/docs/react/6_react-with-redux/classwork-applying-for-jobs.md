While coding skills are important for getting a job in the field, it's absolutely crucial to send job applications to companies if you want to open up communication. Every job you apply for should have its own unique resume and cover letter to show employers that you're interested in them specifically. For this reason, you should not use any "Quick Apply" feature to apply to jobs. Your career advisors will be checking your applications to make sure that your resumes and cover letters are targeted towards job postings.

The purpose of this assignment is to get you prepared for regularly applying to jobs with maximum hiring potential. Your career advisor will be checking your submitted application materials to help optimize your success.

By the end of each Thursday for the next four weeks, you'll be expected to apply for one to three jobs depending on the week. (See the end of this lesson for more details.) On Epicenter, you will send a link to the job posting as your submission along with a link to your Google Spreadsheet job tracker OR to this link (https://nomorecoverletter.com) if you used No More Cover Letter. Tracking your job applications will help you and your career coach keep track of every job that you've applied to, as well as your targeted resumes and cover letters. It's important to keep your tracker updated every time you apply to a job, even after you graduate from Epicodus.

Because the most common roadblock to getting hired is not applying for enough jobs, your Thursday job application requirements will be 8 jobs in total. This week we will ask for two job applications. Next week you will apply to three jobs. The week after you will apply to two jobs, and then during week five of React, you will be expected to apply to at least one job. Then, during the final week of class, you will be submitting your resumes and cover letters to internship companies for interviews.

## Searching for Job Postings

Before you write your application materials, find a job you'd like to apply for following this [lesson on job boards](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/internship-and-job-search/applying-for-internships-and-jobs/job-boards).

### Creating Documents

Create your own job tracker sheet by [copying the template here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tJy8guz0lt_xxN3k9Of9Ty-flkpgGXJHKHfZCy92XZQ/edit#gid=0). To do so, open the link and click on "File" in the top left under "Master Job Tracker." Then, click on the second option, "Make a Copy", rename it, and save it to your Google Drive.

Before you start writing your cover letter and resume, we want to make sure you're clear on how to do so in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/). To create a new Google Doc, head to the main Google Docs page and click on 'Blank' under 'Start a new document.' This will create an empty project for you to fill out with your resume or cover letter. There's no need to save your work because Google Drive automatically tracks your changes.

### No More Cover Letter

Instead of using the Google spreadsheet job tracker, you can use No More Cover Letter to track your job applications. To use, create an account on the website here (https://nomorecoverletter.com). Please note that you must have a Gmail account to sign up. We will be using the email that you have on file for No More Cover Letter. If you want to use a different email, please let us know. Then, upload the access token to gain entry. To upload the access token, go to your profile and find the key button overlay on your profile photo. Enter this access token: pjmwadX0Bie6D0tcmztG

If you use No More Cover Letter, please paste this link (https://nomorecoverletter.com) into the submission box for the career reviews.

### Application Materials

Using the above method of creating Google Docs, follow this [lesson on cover letters](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/internship-and-job-search/applying-for-internships-and-jobs/writing-your-cover-letter) and this [lesson on resumes](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/internship-and-job-search/applying-for-internships-and-jobs/writing-your-resume) to create documents specific to the job you are applying for. It is a common pitfall for students to tailor their cover letters to different employers but send the same resume over and over.

Since you've already gotten feedback on a practice resume and cover letter, you should have a good idea of what to do now that you are applying for a real job. However, we want you to keep getting feedback on how to improve your applications. While working on your resume and cover letter in class, ask for help from your advisor and teacher if you have any questions or want feedback. When you're done, you'll submit your applications to your advisor for review.

### Submitting

Once you have written a resume and cover letter, send in your application to the employer!

Add the links for your resume and cover letter to your job tracking spreadsheet or to No More Cover Letter (make sure they are shared and visible to your advisor), and then submit your job tracker in Epicenter as your career review submission. Even though you've already submitted your applications, your advisor can give you feedback on your resumes and cover letters that you can use to make future applications even better.

To submit your materials as a career review using the Google spreadsheet job tracker, click on the "Share" button at the top of your resume, cover letter, and job search spreadsheet. It will prompt you to give your document a name and then open a window called 'Share with others.' In the top-right of this window, click the button that says 'Get shareable link.' Open the drop-down menu that says 'Anyone with the link can view,' and change the option to 'Anyone with the link can edit,' then copy the resulting link. This way, your advisor can give you feedback directly on your documents and view your job search tracker.

If you use No More Cover Letter, please paste this link (https://nomorecoverletter.com) into the submission box for the career reviews. Please remember to click on the "Share" button at the top of your resume and cover letter so it says ‘Anyone with the link can edit'. This way, your advisor can give you feedback directly on your documents.

### Weekly Expectations

Work with your pair and apply to jobs together. Proofread each other's application material before applying.

Share good job posting finds with each other! Support each other in the job hunt. Your fellow students are your first network of peers in tech. When one person gets a job, your network expands through them. When everyone succeeds after Epicodus, it only reflects better on you for having gone through the program.

**Note:** The schedule below applies to the full-time program. If you are in the part-time program, your schedule will be different. Check with your instructor about dates and expectations.

**React Fundamentals (half-day career services):** Apply to at least two jobs by the end of the day.

**React with Redux (half-day career services):** Apply to three jobs today. You should have at least five job applications by the end of the day.

**React with NoSQL (half-day career services):** Apply to two jobs today. You should have at least seven job applications by the end of the day.

**React with APIs (full-day career services):** Apply to one job application today. You should have at least eight job applications by the end of the day.

[Other career service projects you can do](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11UXzm89gh-RvZ8WLkvuo5cSOvnkcXBiNIvLyfN7gJFI/edit?usp=sharing) if you have extra time during class hours set aside for career services.

You will apply to at least eight jobs between React weeks 2 and 5. However, you may opt to replace a maximum of three of your total job applications with an alternative job-seeking activity. For one of these activities to qualify as a replacement for your job applications, you will need to provide proof of your attendance. Here are the activities you may choose from:

1. Informational interview
   - Please provide a screenshot of the email confirming your meeting or a copy of the notes you took at the interview.
2. Meetup or other networking event
   - Please provide a link to the event and a list of at least 3 people you met.
3. Hackathon or code challenge
   - Please provide a link to the project or code you created.
4. Interview with an employer
   - Please provide a screenshot of your follow-up “thank you” email.

Networking events are a great addition to your job search, however, they should supplement rather than replace job applications.

#### For students in the part-time cohort

For students in the part-time cohort who are arranging their own internship and who have not yet secured their internship, you may choose to replace up to 1 job application per week with internship outreach.

- Please BCC your advisor on any emails sent to potential internship companies or take a screenshot of the email / message and link it in your tracker.
