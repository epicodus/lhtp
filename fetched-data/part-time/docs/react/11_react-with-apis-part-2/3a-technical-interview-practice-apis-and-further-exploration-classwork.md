## Stories and Examples
<hr />

Offering a tangible story or example that highlights your skills usually goes _much further_ in an interview than simply _telling_ your interviewer you're good at something. (i.e.: Telling a story about a time you tracked down a tricky bug versus simply saying _"I'm good at problem-solving!"_).

Review the **STAR** method, discussed in [this lesson on non-technical interviews](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/internship-and-job-search/preparing-for-job-interviews/non-technical-interview). Use the **STAR** method to practice answering non-technical questions with your partner.

Again, if you come up with a story or example you feel good about, jot it down somewhere! It's tough to come up with stories like this in an interview on the spot. Having a few tucked away to review before an interview will be a huge benefit to you later.
