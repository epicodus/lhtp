As discussed in the _[Journaling at Epicodus](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-journaling-at-epicodus)_ lesson, each weekend you'll receive a journaling assignment in addition to your coding homework. You'll then discuss your responses with a partner at the beginning of the next class session.

## Journal Response Discussion
---

### This Section's Prompt

As you'll recall, you were asked to write responses to the following in your journal over the weekend, as detailed in the Journal #7 prompt:

> * What are your goals for this group project? Besides creating a codebase, what do you hope to accomplish? (For example, are you hoping to explore technologies above and beyond what's offered in our curriculum? Practice your project management skills? List anything applicable!)

> * What do you anticipate could potentially stand in your (or your teammates') way to feeling accomplished this section? Consider referring back to previous journal responses. For instance, did you identify yourself as someone that occasionally falls prone to imposter syndrome? Or someone that can become unproductively frustrated by bugs and issues if you don't catch yourself? List anything applicable.

> * How could you increase the feeling of accomplishment experienced with your teammates this section? For each potential roadblock you recorded above, list _at least_ one thing you can do to proactively prevent it from negatively effecting your group project experience.  

### Discussion Questions

Before beginning your group project, meet with your team and discuss your journal responses as a group using the following questions to guide your discussion:

* What did you all identify as your goals (beyond just completing your project idea) for the section? Are they similar? Different? What can you do as a team to ensure everyone meets these goals together, even if some individuals' goals slightly differ?

* What did you identify as possible roadblocks to your project/team's success, and feelings of accomplishment? How many of these are shared amongst team members? How many are unique to individuals?

* Determine what your team can proactively do _now_ to both prevent potential issues later, and maximize what you can accomplish together this section. Take **all** goals and potential roadblocks identified by all team members into account, and develop a plan. (For instance, if one member has a goal to gain project management experience, and another member shared hesitations about communication skills, perhaps the first team member could be responsible for holding a couple regular team stand-ups a day, to check in and keep communication flowing?)
