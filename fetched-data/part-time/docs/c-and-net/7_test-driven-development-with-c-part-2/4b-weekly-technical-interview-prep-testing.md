At the end of every section, we'll take a break from coding to practice interview questions with our partner. These questions will (primarily) revolve around the content we learned in the section, and, much like a "real" interview, some will be more technical than others.

In addition to learning how to implement the new tools, technologies, and concepts, you want to become comfortable _talking_ about them so you can accurately _demonstrate_ and _communicate_ these skills you've learned to potential employers in an interview.

Take turns answering the questions below with your partner.

## Technical Interview Questions
---

* What is encapsulation? Why is encapsulation so important in object-oriented programming?
* What is abstraction? How can we use it to help encapsulate our code?
* What is the difference between `public` and `private` methods? When should we use `public` methods and when should we use `private` methods?
* What is separation of concerns? What are some techniques we can use to write well-separated code?
* What is the difference between `static` and `instance` methods? When should we use one or the other?
* What are the benefits of namespacing our classes?
* What are getters and setters?
* Why should we separate out our `Main()` method into another class?

## Stories and Examples
---

Offering a tangible story or example that highlights your skills usually goes _much further_ in an interview than simply _telling_ your interviewer you're good at something. (i.e.: Telling a story about a time you tracked down a tricky bug versus simply saying _"I'm good at problem-solving!"_).

Review the **STAR** method, discussed in [this lesson on non-technical interviews](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/internship-and-job-search/preparing-for-job-interviews/non-technical-interview). Use the **STAR** method to practice answering non-technical questions with your partner.

Again, if you come up with a story or example you feel good about, jot it down somewhere! It's tough to come up with stories like this in an interview on the spot. Having a few tucked away to review before an interview will be a huge benefit to you later.
