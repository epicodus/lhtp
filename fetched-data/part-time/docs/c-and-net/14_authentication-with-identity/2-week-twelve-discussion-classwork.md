As discussed in the _[Journaling at Epicodus](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-journaling-at-epicodus)_ lesson, each weekend you'll receive a journaling assignment in addition to your coding homework. You'll then discuss your responses with a partner at the beginning of the next class session.

## Journal Response Discussion

### This section's Prompt

You were asked to write responses to the following in your journal over the weekend, as detailed in the Journal #12 prompt:

> * Read through the _Core Values_ list below, and determine which three values you most identify with, are most drawn to, or find most important in your own life. Write these down.

> * How have these values shown themselves in your previous work? Whether work here at Epicodus, or on previous teams? Jot down an example for each.

> * How do these values positively contribute to a team or work environment? How could they contribute to a future team?

> * Do these values inform what type of work you find fulfilling? Or the type of company/team you'd like to work for? (Refer back to your ideal job description from section eight's journal prompt, if necessary).

### Discussion Questions

Discuss what you recorded in your journal with your partner.

* What did you each identify as your core values?

* Explain how these these values have impacted your work in the past, both at Epicodus and otherwise.

* What about the future? How do these values inform or impact your future career goals or trajectory?

* How do you think these values could be communicated in your personal narratives? Do you see a theme in your partner's stories that would make a great narrative to depict in a cover letter or interview? Discuss.
