At the end of every course section, we'll take a break from coding to practice interview questions with our partner. These questions will (primarily) revolve around the content we learned in this section, and, much like a "real" interview, some will be more technical than others.

In addition to learning how to implement the new tools, technologies, and concepts, you want to become comfortable _talking_ about them too, so you may accurately _demonstrate_ and _communicate_ these skills you've learned to potential employers in an interview.

Take turns answering the questions below with your partner:

## Technical Interview Questions
---

* Walk through the differences between a one-to-many and a many-to-many database relationship.
* Describe a use case for a many-to-many relationship. What about a one-to-many?
* What is the purpose of a join table? What should be included in a join table? What shouldn't be?
* What information or object does a join entity represent?
* What is a migration? How do migrations make it easier for developers to work together on a large codebase?
* What is a navigation property and what purpose do it serve in EF Core?
* From what routes is it _possible_ to create a new entry in your join table? From which routes does it make the most sense?
* What is model validation?
* What is a validation attribute and how do we use it in our C# models?

## Stories and Examples
---


Offering a tangible story or example that highlights your skills usually goes _much further_ in an interview than simply _telling_ your interviewer you're good at something. (i.e.: Telling a story about a time you tracked down a tricky bug versus simply saying _"I'm good at problem-solving!"_).

Review the **STAR** method, discussed in [this lesson on non-technical interviews](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/internship-and-job-search/preparing-for-job-interviews/non-technical-interview). Use the **STAR** method to practice answering non-technical questions with your partner.

Again, if you come up with a story or example you feel good about, jot it down somewhere! It's tough to come up with stories like this in an interview on the spot. Having a few tucked away to review before an interview will be a huge benefit to you later.
