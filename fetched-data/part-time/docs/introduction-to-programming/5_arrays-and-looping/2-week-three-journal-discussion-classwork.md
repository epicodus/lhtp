As discussed in the _[Journaling at Epicodus](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-journaling-at-epicodus)_ lesson, each weekend you'll receive a journaling assignment in addition to your coding homework. You'll then discuss your responses with a partner at the beginning of the next class session.

## Journal Response Discussion

### This Section's Prompt

As you'll recall, you were asked to write responses to the following in your journal over the weekend, as detailed in the Journal #3 prompt:

>* What is it about encountering a difficult task or bug that frustrates you? Do you have any behavior patterns that make solving these problems more difficult? (For example, do you always feel pressured to finish projects quickly, making time setbacks involved in bugs stressful or upsetting? Does being uncertain how to solve a bug evoke feelings of not being 'good' or 'smart' enough?, etc.) List as many as applicable.

>* Conversely, is there anything about tricky bugs or issues you actually _enjoy_? (It's okay if there isn't, but do you like hunting down the problem? The debugging process? The satisfaction of finally making it work?) Do you have any patterns of behavior that make solving problems easier or less stressful?

>* Review the list of things you find frustrating. For each item, identify something you could try to lessen that frustration, and turn the situation into a productive educational experience. (For instance, if the time setback is what stresses you most about bugs, could you plan on reminding yourself that Epicodus _doesn't_ grade students on the amount of work they finish each day?)

>* Review the list of things you actually find _enjoyable_ about tracking down bugs, if anything. Is there anything you could do to maximize this benefit or enjoyment? List your ideas.

### Discussion Questions

Before beginning today's programming work, spend a few minutes discussing what you recorded in your journal with your partner, using the following questions as a guide:

* What did you each identify as the most frustrating parts of encountering bugs? Did you record similar things? Different ones?

* What did you say you _enjoy_ about tackling bugs? What similarities or differences exist in your and your partner's answers?

* Share the tactics you recorded for minimizing frustration. Give feedback. Share tips.

* Based on what you just learned about each other--what you each find most frustrating about bugs, what you find enjoyable, and how you think you can lessen any frustration--develop a game plan. How will you hold each other accountable today? How will you turn any roadblocks into a beneficial, educational experience together?
