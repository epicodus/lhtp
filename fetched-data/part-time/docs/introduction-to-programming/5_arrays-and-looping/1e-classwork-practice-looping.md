**Goal:**  In the Looping lesson, we learned:

* How to use an `Array.prototype.forEach()` loop.
* Naming conventions for arrays and the parameter in a loop.

As we can see, looping is an incredibly important programming concept. Now it's time to practice. We'll begin with two looping exercises in the console and then move on to creating a small project.

## Warm Up
---

* If we used `Array.prototype.forEach()` to loop through an array called "kittens", what should we call the parameter in the `Array.prototype.forEach()` function? Why?
* What does the `+=` operator do?

## Code
---

Complete both of the exercises listed below.

### Looping Practice in the DevTools Console

* Make an array of your friends' names. Loop through it and `console.log()` a greeting to each friend in the array.
* Write a loop to multiply an arbitrary amount of numbers. This should look similar to the code to sum numbers from the "forEach Looping" lesson.

### Favorite Ice Cream Flavors

* Make a web page that lists out your favorite ice cream flavors. Rather than writing the flavors in the HTML, use a JavaScript loop to insert the flavors into the page from an array. Use the `document.createElement()` and `Element.append()` or `Element.prepend()` methods to create and add elements to your webpage.
