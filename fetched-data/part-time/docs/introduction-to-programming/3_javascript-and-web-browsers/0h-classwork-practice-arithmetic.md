**Goal:**   In the Arithmetic lesson, we learned:

* How to access the DevTools Console.
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using JavaScript operators.
* `NaN` means _not a number_ but is actually considered a type of number. 
* `Infinity` represents infinity and is also a type of number.

Begin getting comfortable with these concepts by completing the practice exercises listed below. Soon enough, they'll be second nature!

## Warm Up
<hr />

_Make sure you understand the following before moving on:_

* What is an expression in JavaScript?
* How can we access the DevTools console?
* When might we see `NaN`?

## Code
<hr />

Complete the following exercises to practice arithmetic in JavaScript. If you are with a pair, switch off between every section (i.e.: "Add", "Subtract", etc.) or between every prompt (e.g.: "77 to 99", "99 from 665").

#### Add:

 * 77 to 99
 * 34 to 1233
 * -53 to 99

#### Subtract:

 * 99 from 665
 * 555 from 23
 * 6,348,709,234 from 87,023,984,709,871,234

#### Multiply:

 * 89 and 54
 * 932 and 1,900
 * -34 and 8

#### Divide:

 * 1008 by 7
 * 9,870,834,205,987 by 324
 * A number by 0.
 * 0 by 0.
