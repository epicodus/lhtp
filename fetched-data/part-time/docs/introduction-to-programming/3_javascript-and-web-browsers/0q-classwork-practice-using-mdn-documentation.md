**Goal**: In the lesson on using MDN documentation, we learned:

* Documentation is an umbrella term that includes tutorials, guides, references, and links to other resources and tools.
* MDN has references for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS among other topics.
* MDN has a search feature on the website, and MDN can also be accessed via Google searches.
* MDN reference pages have built-in consoles that we can use to test out code.

## Warm Up
<hr />

* What does the official syntax for naming a method look like?
* Why is it important to be comfortable working with documentation and researching online?
* What is the good and the bad of following "rabbit holes"?

## Code

### Practice Navigating MDN

For folks who are working through this practice in pairs, switch off who's driving and observing in between each of the following prompts.

1. Starting on the [MDN homepage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), navigate to the JavaScript Reference homepage.
2. Find the MDN reference page for the method to lower case a string by searching on Google or using MDN's search feature.
3. Find the MDN reference page for the `String.prototype.charAt()` method by searching on Google or using MDN's search feature.
4. Search for the reference page for `String.prototype.slice()`. Read about how this method works and use MDN's built-in console to try out this method.
5. Search for the reference page for `String.prototype.subString()`. Read about how this method works and use MDN's built-in console to try out this method.
