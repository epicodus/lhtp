Welcome to your seventh day of Epicodus!

Here is today's schedule and expectations.

## Schedule
---

Times are approximate.

**8:00 – 8:15 am: Dev Team Scrum**

You'll start everyday with a meeting with your dev team. We call this meeting "Dev Team Scrum". Note that you'll have the same dev team for the entire course section (which lasts a week or two). If you are having any issues with members of your dev team, please reach out to an instructor.

The first thing you should do during your Dev Team Scrum is sign in to the Epicodus attendance system. You should also remind your fellow dev team members to do this as well so that no one forgets!

Next, make sure that everyone is present for the Dev Team Scrum: 

- If you are an online student, this includes conducting a connectivity debugging session. Is everyone able to access the voice channel in Discord? If not, take a few minutes to make sure everyone is taking part. Remember, if you have recurring issues, reach out to an instructor. When everyone is connected, you can start your brief group check-in.
- If you are studying in person, take the time to make sure that everyone who is in your dev team and present for class is together before start your brief group check-in.

As a reminder, **Dev Team Scrum** includes a brief group check-in to talk about anything that came up during the last class session — such as things you've learned or things that you find exciting or frustrating. This is also a great time to ask each other questions about any content that you might find confusing. As covered in the lesson about [working with a dev team](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/pre-work/getting-started-with-intro-to-programming/working-with-a-dev-team), in about 15 minutes, each student in the dev team should answer these 3 questions:

* What did you work on in the last class session or over the weekend?
* What are you working on today?
* What blocks do you have? What is standing in your way?

Once everyone has had a chance to speak, the next step is to find a pair from within your Dev Team. If there is an odd number of people in your dev team, there will be one group of three. 

**8:15 – 8:30 am: Cohort Scrum**

Next, you'll have an instructor-led Cohort Scrum. This Scrum meeting is a shorter check-in on weekdays, so more time is spent coding. This is a great time to bring questions about the curriculum to your instructor.

**8:30 – 11:40 am: Pair Programming** 

**11:40 – 12:00 pm: Show and Tell Retrospective**

Every day at the end of class, you will meet with your dev team in Discord to discuss how the day went. We call this meeting a "retrospective". While companies usually don't have _daily_ retrospectives, this is a good practice for students to maximize learning and share work. It's also a great time to get to know your cohort peers.

Here are potential topics to cover in the retrospective:

* Show and tell: what did you create today? Share your screen and walkthrough your code.
* What did you enjoy the most?
* What is a bug you fixed? Share your screen and give a walkthrough.
* What did you struggle with?
* Share tips and resources you found useful.
* Give shout-outs to anyone in your group who has helped you or that you appreciate in general.
* Discuss what you want to do better tomorrow.

## Seventh Day Expectations
