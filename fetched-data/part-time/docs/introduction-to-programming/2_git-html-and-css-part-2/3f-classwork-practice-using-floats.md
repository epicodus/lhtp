**Goal**: In the Laying out with floats lesson, we learned how to use floats to:

* Wrap text around an image
* Create sidebars
* Create pages with multiple columns

In this exercise we'll practice these concepts by creating new webpages, and utilizing floats to organize their layouts.

## Warm Up
<hr />

* What different options are available when using floats?
* What can be accomplished with floats?

## Code
<hr />

Meet the goal by completing one of these projects. Make sure to make commits regularly and push to the project's remote repository on GitHub.

### Floats Practice

Practice using floats to position images, create sidebars, and make column layouts. Again, don't forget to create a separate folder for each project below, make commits regularly and push all changes to a remote repository on GitHub.

#### Band Website
