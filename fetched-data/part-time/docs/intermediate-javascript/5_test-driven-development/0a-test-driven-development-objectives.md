In this section, we'll focus on two important aspects of JavaScript development:

* **Modern development environments**: We'll create an environment that will make it easier to incorporate JavaScript libraries and scaffold large projects.
* **Test-driven development**: We'll write automated tests before writing our code.

We will use **Jest**, a tool for writing coded, automated tests. We'll learn about **module bundling** with **webpack** to keep our code base well-organized and efficient, and we'll incorporate tools that help us do other tasks like **linting**, which we can use to quickly spot errors.

Finally, we'll learn about JavaScript features from **ECMAScript 6** (ES6) such as classes, arrow functions, modules, template literals, and more!

## Independent Project Objectives
---

At the end of this section, you will complete an independent project. Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Business logic has 100% line coverage with Jest.
* Tests are included for each business logic behavior and code is committed after each test passes.
* Project utilizes classes, a feature of ES6.
* Dependencies are managed with npm.
* webpack is used to lint, bundle, and process code.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The prompt's required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.
