As discussed in the _[Journaling at Epicodus](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-journaling-at-epicodus)_ lesson, each weekend you'll receive a journaling assignment in addition to your coding homework. You'll then discuss your responses with a partner at the beginning of the next class session.

## Journal Response Discussion
---

### This Section's Prompt

As you'll recall, you were asked to write responses to the following in your journal over the weekend, as detailed in the Journal #8 prompt:

> * What were your most notable _non-technical_ discoveries during this exercise? Whether about yourself, group communication, working with others, or something else?
>
> * What were your greatest strengths? What about your biggest areas for improvement?
>
> * Identify what you can do in the next six sections to further develop any areas for improvement before the next group project.
>
> * Overall, what would you do differently next time? Is there a lesson to be learned and brought with you to your pairing or next group work experience?  

### Discussion Questions

Before beginning programming work, discuss what you recorded in your journal with your partner using the following questions as a guide:

* What did you each identify as your most notable non-technical discovery or achievement? What made it notable? Is your partner's newfound knowledge something that could benefit you, too? Why or why not. Or did your partner share a realization you already underwent? Do you have additional insight or perspective to share?

* Discuss the areas of improvement you identified. Do you share any? Brainstorm potential methods to practice and improve in each person's areas for improvement (as they're comfortable sharing) together.

* Discuss both what you think went _really well_ in each of your group projects, and what could go better next time.
