## Whiteboard Practice
---

When and how whiteboarding practice is implemented will be up to your teacher. Below is a recommended prompt.

### Goal

As the interviewee:

* Ask clarifying questions.
* Keep talking.
* Explain your plan at the beginning; recap what youâ€™ve done at the end.
* Make eye contact.
* Plan your space.

As the interviewer:

* Answer questions as best as you can.
* Be encouraging. Whiteboarding is difficult!
* Be patient. Only offer hints if your partner indicates that they need help.
* Be engaged. Part of this practice is getting used to having someone evaluate your work as your produce it.
* Offer _constructive_ feedback. Find at least one thing that your partner did well _and_ one thing they could improve at.

### Problem

**1st Prompt**: 
If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

Write a method that given a number between 1 and 1000, returns the number of letters in the given number as a word.


NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.


**Examples**:

  * Given: 7, Output: 5

  * Given: 24, Output: 10


**2nd Prompt**: Write a method that given 1 number, returns the sum of all of the square numbers up to that given number.


**Examples**:

  * Given: 20, Output: 30 (1 + 4 + 9 + 16)

  * Given: 30, Output: 55 (1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25)


### Further Exploration

* Write a method that given two numbers, returns the number of letters in the sum (as a word) of the 2 given numbers. 
  * **Examples**:
      * Given: 7, 2 Output: 7

      * Given: 3, 24  Output: 13

* Write a method that given 2 number, returns the sum of all of the square numbers in the range between the two given numbers. 
  * **Examples**:
      * Given: 20, 30 Output: 25 

      * Given: 15, 50  Output: 126 (16 + 25 + 36 + 49)
