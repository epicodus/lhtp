At the end of every course section, we'll take a break from coding to practice interview questions with our partner. These questions will (primarily) revolve around the content we learned in this section, and, much like a "real" interview, some will be more technical than others.

In addition to learning how to implement the new tools, technologies, and concepts, you want to become comfortable _talking_ about them too, so you may accurately _demonstrate_ and _communicate_ these skills you've learned to potential employers in an interview.

Take turns answering the questions below with your partner:

## Technical Interview Questions
---

* What does it mean to scaffold an application? What are the advantages and disadvantages of scaffolding?
* What is the difference between an API application and an MVC application?
* What is serialization? Why is it useful?
* What is deserialization and why is it necessary in an MVC application?
* Why should we use environmental variables with API calls?
* What is JSON? Why is it a commonly used format for API calls?
* Explain the differences between a few different status codes. Here are a few examples: 200, 401, 403, 500.
* What is CORS? What are its advantages and disadvantages?
* Why should we use versioning in an API application?
* What is a JWT? Why would we use JWTs with an API application?
* When would we use pagination in an API application? What benefits does it provide?

## Stories and Examples

Offering a tangible story or example that highlights your skills usually goes _much further_ in an interview than simply _telling_ your interviewer you're good at something. (i.e.: Telling a story about a time you tracked down a tricky bug versus simply saying _"I'm good at problem-solving!"_).

Review the **STAR** method, discussed in [this lesson on non-technical interviews](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/internship-and-job-search/preparing-for-job-interviews/non-technical-interview). Use the **STAR** method to practice answering non-technical questions with your partner.

Again, if you come up with a story or example you feel good about, jot it down somewhere! It's tough to come up with stories like this in an interview on the spot. Having a few tucked away to review before an interview will be a huge benefit to you later.
