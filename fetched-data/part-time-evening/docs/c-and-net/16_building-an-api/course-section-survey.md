This is a survey for the previous course section you just completed at the end of last week. We rely on this survey to get a general view of is and isn’t working well in the program, the curriculum, or our classroom model.

If you’re having difficulties with a peer, please be sure to also regularly fill out **pair feedback** in Epicenter. This helps us aggregate feedback regarding working with that person. We'll only talk to that person if we start to see a pattern of bad pairing experiences. 

Otherwise, if you're having any issue and need immediate support, please reach out directly to your instructor.
