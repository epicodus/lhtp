In this course your evolution as a developer will go from outside observer to a fully participating member of the developer community.  To find direction for our JavaScript applications, we will be spending much more time using the same online documentation that JS developers use in the field.  

## [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

MDN is one of the best sources of documentation on JavaScript. The site includes guides, tutorials, reference, tools and resources for developers using JavaScript.

## [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

This is the official Node site for all things Node.
