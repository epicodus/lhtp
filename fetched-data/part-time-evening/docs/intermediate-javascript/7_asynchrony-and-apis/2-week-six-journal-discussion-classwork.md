As discussed in the _[Journaling at Epicodus](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-journaling-at-epicodus)_ lesson, each weekend you'll receive a journaling assignment in addition to your coding homework. You'll then discuss your responses with a partner at the beginning of the next class session.

## Journal Response Discussion

### This Section's Prompt

As you'll recall, you were asked to write responses to the following in your journal over the weekend, as detailed in the Journal #6 prompt:

> After browsing a decent number of job postings, **write a description for your own ideal future job**. This can be formatted as a job posting, or a list of attributes.
>
> Your list/posting can contain anything. Identify traits you found appealing in jobs you saw. And traits you already know you desire in a job. Did you like the idea of working with a specific technology? For a team that volunteers in the community? In a dog-friendly office? Working remotely? Free snacks? Great benefits? A big team? A small team? Travel opportunities? Full stack work? Back end work?

### Discussion Questions

Before beginning today's in-class work, discuss what you recorded in your journal with your partner.

* Share what traits you identified as desirable in a future job. What do you find appealing about them? Why? Are your ideal jobs similar? Different?

* Do you know what your post-graduation goals are? (It's okay if you aren't positive!) Share anything you _do_ already know, no matter how big or small. (Will you seek work in Portland or Seattle? Or move elsewhere? etc.)

* Can the two of you brainstorm anything you could do _right now_ to get one step closer to these goals? (For instance, if there's a local company you'd like to potentially work for, could you start attending their meetups? Or if you want to work in a specific technology, could you make sure your next group project or independent capstone project uses this technology, to gain practice?)
