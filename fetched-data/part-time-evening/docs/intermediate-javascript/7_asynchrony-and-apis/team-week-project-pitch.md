In the next course section, we will be working on group projects for the Epicodus Developer Trade Show to take place at the end of the section. In preparation, we'll take this coming section to generate ideas and sign up for teams, so we'll be organized and ready to go by the start of Team Week. 

## Homework
---

Generate an idea you would like to help develop into a working application. It could be a game, a new business idea, something educational, something fun, something to help others or something to change the world, an application or website a friend or family member could use, etc.

### Past Student Work

Ready to brainstorm? Here are a few examples of projects past students have built during Team Week. You're not required to choose from this list, of course (although you may, if something really speaks to you!), this is only to begin your own brainstorming: 

#### Planning Activities

Sites and applications that help plan: 

* Vacations
* Camping trips
* Road trips
* Weddings and other events
* Pub crawls
* etc. 

#### Lending a Hand

Sites and applications that aim to help people out, such as: 

* Locate stolen bike
* Reporting/searching for missing pets
* Organizing/compiling resources for at-risk populations
* Helping people prepare for/respond to  natural disasters

#### Connect People

Sites and applications that aim to bring people together, such as: 

* Helping musicians find other musicians for jam sessions
* Locating puppy playdates
* Dating sites of all varieties, themes, focuses and interests
* Interest-based meetups and events
* Communication tools, like chat rooms, web forums, and more
* Virtual study groups and other learning tools

#### Games 

Playable games, for instance:

* Text-oriented games like "Choose your own adventure"-style storytelling games
* RPGs
* Word and math games
* Turn-based games
* Oregon Trail-style side-scrollers
* Digital versions of classic favorites like Clue, Poker, Magic, Chess, Monopoly, Breakout, etc. 

#### Working with specific libraries, frameworks, or APIs

Some students choose to work with specific libraries, frameworks or APIs to build out games, tooling, or an experience. There are so many libraries out there to explore! For instance:

* Using Three.js to make a 3D model or experience
* Using Unity game engine to make a game
* Using music libraries or the Spotify API (or another service) to build out web apps that visualize, track, or make music.
* Building a website with a new framework 

#### Developer Tooling

For instance:

* A VS Code color theme or other type of extension
* An npm package
* A Discord bot
* A browser extension

#### Tracking, Aggregating, or Visualize Data

Applications that help track and manage data of some kind, such as:

* Food diaries
* Workout tracking
* Mood trackers

Or applications that _do something_ with outside data pulled from an API. Check out [this list](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis/blob/master/README.md) of APIs for ideas. 

#### Productivity Tools

Websites aimed to help make you more productive, like: 

* Checklists
* Organizers
* Note-taking tools
* Crowd-sourced to-do lists, or grocery shopping lists
* Point of Sale systems

#### Websites for Real People

Additionally, past students have created functioning websites or applications for family and friends' small local businesses, including catering companies, dog groomers, and more. 

## Timeline
---

Your instructor will give you exact instructions on how to share project ideas, where to sign up for teams, and team sizes. All students need to be signed up for a team week group by the end of this course section. If you have not signed up by the end of this course section, your instruction will assign you to a group.

### Over the Weekend and at the Start of this Section

#### _Brainstorm and Share Ideas_ 

Start brainstorming project ideas now. At the start of this section, your instructor will provide you with a location to share ideas, either on a whiteboard in class or a spreadsheet online. Begin listing your ideas, and make sure you include:

* A title 
* A brief description of the project
* Your name 

During the beginning of this section, ideas will be added and updated on the board. Feel free to talk to potential groups; and ask questions. We want you to sign up for a project you feel interested in and passionate about! 

### Half Way Through this Section 
#### _Sign Up_

Your instructor will give you a sign up deadline. Everyone is required to sign up for a team before the end of this section. There is also a size limit to teams that your instructor will set. If a team already is at the size limit, it is full and cannot take on additional members.   

###  At the End of this Section
#### _Confirmation_

At the end of this section, your instructor will confirm all teams have the correct number of members and an adequate project idea. If teams have too few members we'll help connect you with additional teammates, or re-arrange teams as necessary. 

You won't begin working on your project until the next course section, but you're encouraged trade contact information with your teammates and consider planning and brainstorming together outside of class!
