## Independent Projects Overview
---

Project prompts will be available on Epicenter at 8:00 am Friday for full-time students and 8:00 am on Thursday for part-time students. Before you begin your project, make sure to take a moment to review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/pre-work/getting-started-at-epicodus/independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson.

## Asynchrony and APIs Project Objectives
---

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Does the application correctly make an API call?
* Does the application correctly parse data from the API response?
* Does the application handle errors when the API call doesn't return a 200 OK status as well as return a message if the API returns no results?
* Did you follow all setup instructions, including storing your API key and adding instructions for setup in your README?
* Does the app separate logic into different JavaScript files and use a static method?
* Does the application correctly use webpack?
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The prompt's required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.

### What is a polished, portfolio-quality state?
When a project is both polished and in a portfolio-quality state, this means:

* You've reviewed your project and your README prior to submitting it to make sure there are no errors or missing information and you are consistent in your indentation, spacing, and code structure. 
* You are following the best practices and coding conventions we teach.

### What are the baseline project requirements?
All independent coding projects at Epicodus have these baseline requirements:

* A complete and informative README
* The project's commit history demonstrates that the project's required work schedule and hours have been met:
  * 8 hours completed on Friday is required for full-time students
  * 4 hours completed over the weekend is required for part-time students
* Completion of the project based on the prompt _and_ objectives. The prompt contains details on the project's theme and features that are not always detailed in the objective. Carefully read through the prompt towards the end of your work session to make sure that you are not missing anything.
