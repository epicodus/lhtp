**Goal:**  In the Assignment, Comparison, and Equality Operators lesson, we learned:

* The difference between `=` and `===`
* The assignment operators for each of the mathematical functions: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`
* Comparison operators, including `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`
* Equality operators, including `===` and `!==`

Take time to practice using these operators by completing the exercises listed below.

## Warm Up
<hr />

* What is the difference between a comparison operator and an assignment operator?
* What is a boolean? What does it represent?
* How is the `+=` operator different from the `+` operator?

## Code
<hr />

### Assignment & Comparison Practice

Practice assigning and comparing:

* Set two variables equal to two different numbers. Use a comparison operator to compare these two variables. 
* Change one of their values by using the `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, or `/=` operator. 
* Then, compare their values again.

If you are working with a pair, switch who's driving and observing and continue with this practice:

* Try out the `<=` and `>=` operators by comparing two numbers.
* Try out using `===` equality operator by comparing two strings.
* Next, use the `!==` equality operator on two strings or numbers to get a `true` and `false` return value.
