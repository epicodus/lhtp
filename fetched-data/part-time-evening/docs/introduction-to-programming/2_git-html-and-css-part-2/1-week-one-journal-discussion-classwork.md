As discussed in the _[Journaling at Epicodus](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-journaling-at-epicodus)_ lesson, each weekend you'll receive a journaling assignment in addition to your coding homework. You'll then discuss your responses with a partner at the beginning of the next class session.

## Journal Response Discussion
---

### This Section's Prompt

As you'll recall, you were asked to write responses to the following in your journal over the weekend, as detailed in the Journal #1 prompt:

> * Why did you make the decision to enroll in a coding bootcamp? What are you aiming to achieve by completing multiple months of technical trainings?
>
> * Do you already have specific goals for yourself in mind? If not, can you think of any now?

### Discussion Questions

Before beginning today's programming work, spend a few minutes discussing what you recorded in your journal with your partner, using the following questions as a guide:

* Are your goals and reasons for enrolling similar? Dissimilar? How and why?

* You're both about to start a long journey together! Get to know each other a little.

Aim to spend no more than 15 or so minutes writing and discussing this prompt. Afterwards, advance to the next lesson where you'll continue learning important fundamentals you'll use _every day_ for the entire program and beyond!
