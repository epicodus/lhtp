Welcome to your fourth day of Epicodus — and your first Sunday class! Maybe it feels like it's already been a long week so far — or maybe you feel like you're starting to get in the swing of things. Maybe you're feeling a bit of both. That's normal — you're learning a lot of new material at once and it takes getting used to.

Here is today's schedule and expectations.

## Schedule
---

**9:00 – 9:30 am: Dev Team Scrum**

You'll start everyday with a meeting with your dev team. We call this meeting "Dev Team Scrum". Note that you'll have the same dev team for the entire course section (which lasts a week or two). If you are having any issues with members of your dev team, please reach out to an instructor.

The first thing you should do during your Dev Team Scrum is sign in to the Epicodus attendance system. You should also remind your fellow dev team members to do this as well so that no one forgets!

Next, make sure that everyone is present for the Dev Team Scrum: 

- If you are an online student, this includes conducting a connectivity debugging session. Is everyone able to access the voice channel in Discord? If not, take a few minutes to make sure everyone is taking part. Remember, if you have recurring issues, reach out to an instructor. When everyone is connected, you can start your brief group check-in.
- If you are studying in person, take the time to make sure that everyone who is in your dev team and present for class is together before start your brief group check-in.

As a reminder, **Dev Team Scrum** includes a brief group check-in to talk about anything that came up during the last class session — such as things you've learned or things that you find exciting or frustrating. This is also a great time to ask each other questions about any content that you might find confusing. As covered in the lesson about [working with a dev team](https://new.learnhowtoprogram.com/pre-work/getting-started-with-intro-to-programming/working-with-a-dev-team), in about 15 minutes, each student in the dev team should answer these 3 questions:

* What did you work on in the last class session or over the weekend?
* What are you working on today?
* What blocks do you have? What is standing in your way?

Once everyone has had a chance to speak, the next step is to find a pair from within your Dev Team. If there is an odd number of people in your dev team, there will be one group of three. 

**9:30 – 10:00 am: Cohort Scrum**

Next, you'll have a Cohort Scrum meeting with your cohort and your instructor. This is the usual Scrum that you'll take part in every Sunday for the rest of the program. 

**Cohort Scrum** is a time for your instructor(s) to make announcements, and for you to ask questions. Since we have more time for Scrum on Sundays, it's a great time to go over key concepts from the previous week. 

Take note that Cohort Scrums can vary in length depending on what needs to be discussed. If you are having any problems accessing the meeting, reach out to an instructor.

**10:00 – 1 pm: Pair Programming**

**1:00 – 2:00 pm: Lunch**

**2:00 – 4:30 pm: Pair Programming**

**4:30 – 5:00 pm: Show and Tell Retrospective**

From now on, every day at the end of class, you will meet with your dev team in Discord to discuss how the day went. We call this meeting a "retrospective". While companies usually don't have _daily_ retrospectives, this is a good practice for students to maximize learning and share work. It's also a great time to get to know your cohort peers.

Here are potential topics to cover in the retrospective:

* Show and tell: what did you create today? Share your screen and walkthrough your code.
* What did you enjoy the most?
* What is a bug you fixed? Share your screen and give a walkthrough.
* What did you struggle with?
* Share tips and resources you found useful.
* Give shout-outs to anyone in your group who has helped you or that you appreciate in general.
* Discuss what you want to do better tomorrow.

## Fourth Day Expectations
---

Today we'll continue building on last week's concepts and learn some new ones as well.

* CSS Styling
* Debugging HTML and CSS
* Git branching and merging
* Markdown and writing READMEs
* Deploying to GitHub Pages

For this section's independent project, you will be required to add a CSS stylesheet, use Markdown in your README, and deploy your site to GitHub pages. Independent project prompts are released on Thursday at the end of the course section and due the following Sunday.

**Take note:** on short weeks, daily expectations change, and you may cover more or less content on a given class day.
