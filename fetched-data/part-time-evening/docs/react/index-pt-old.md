Welcome to React.

React is a JavaScript library used to create dynamic, interactive user interfaces. It allows a site to quickly update many different elements at once, without reloading the page. Since its development at Facebook in 2011 it has exploded in popularity. In fact, a recent survey by the popular question-and-answer site Stack Overflow reported React's usage increased by over 300% in 2016 alone.

Examples of companies and products that use React include AirBnB, BBC, Ebay, Facebook, Instagram, Lyft, Netflix, New York Times, Reddit, Nike, Pinterest, Paypal, and many more.
