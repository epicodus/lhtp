Well, we can do this here, since we already tested that ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"timeOpen")," and ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"formattedWaitTime")," are properly set to a new date and a new date formatted by date-fns when we tested the ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"ADD_TICKET")," action in our ticket-list-reducer. With our ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"addTicket()")," action creator, our only goal is to make sure that our action creator properly includes these two properties as it creates our action.
