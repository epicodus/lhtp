The solution here is to use the option to pass in a function to ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"setTimer")," instead of a new state value:"),(0,o.kt)("pre",null,(0,o.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-js"},"setTimer(timerState => timerState + 1)\n")),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"With this callback function, our ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"useState")," hook will handle passing in the ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"timer")," state as the value for the ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"timerState")," parameter.
