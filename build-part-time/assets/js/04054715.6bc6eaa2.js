Additionally, you'll be collaborating with other developers throughout the process, so expect to stretch the collaboration skills you've developed through pair programming at Epicodus.  While in your own projects, you may be in the position to act quickly and make decisions without input from other developers. When it comes to open source projects you will have to discuss potential changes and next steps with other folks on the project before acting. You will be getting in touch with strong decision makers and very talented developers.  You may have to make a strong case to convince them to enact your solutions or the design you have chosen,  but it is always beneficial to brainstorm together and bounce your ideas around."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"You'll also learn a lot about organization and prioritization. Open source projects usually have a clearly defined roadmap for the sake of collaborating with other contributors who need to know where the project is heading next. As such, when you actively contribute to open source projects, you benefit from this transparency and you will be able to evaluate the risks associated with required features or bug fixes more precisely. You can learn from the structure created by other folks on the team, and implement similar roadmaps for your own projects. "),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Volunteering your time to work on an open-source project is a great way to network, too. This is especially true if you are more introverted and don't enjoy traditional networking. Open source work is a structured networking opportunity with concrete tasks to focus on and discuss with other volunteers.  If you pick a project that interests you, you'll be connecting with other people who share those interests. You might find a mentor, or help others who are just starting their developer journey. Overall, being involved in open source can enrich your career journey. You'll find that these unique experiences are great for building skills, and make great talking points on your resumes, cover letters, and in interviews.
