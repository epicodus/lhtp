It does this without making alterations to the current state or storing that data anywhere.","sidebar":"react"},"react/team-week-part-2/team-week-objectives":{"id":"react/team-week-part-2/team-week-objectives","title":"Team Week Objectives","description":"You\'re a team and you\'re building something awesome!","sidebar":"react"},"react/team-week-part-2/team-week-presentations-and-code-review":{"id":"react/team-week-part-2/team-week-presentations-and-code-review","title":"Team Week Presentations and Code Review","description":"Trade Show Presentations","sidebar":"react"},"react/team-week/backend-course-preparation-software-installation":{"id":"react/team-week/backend-course-preparation-software-installation","title":"Backend Course Preparation: Software Installation","description":"It\'s time to prepare for the next course by installing all relevant software!

We have used Git to backup our work and save our changes as we go, but it is also a powerful tool for working in a group.","sidebar":"react"},"react/team-week/git-with-collaborators-workflow":{"id":"react/team-week/git-with-collaborators-workflow","title":"Git with Collaborators: Workflow","description":"When we work on a development project as a collaborator, we have commit privileges to the main repository on GitHub.

This is a common workflow in the industry. In this workflow, a developer pulls down the latest code from the main branch and creates a new branch. When a feature is completed, the new branch is committed and pushed to GitHub. Then the developer makes a pull request so the code can be merged into the main branch via GitHub\'s UI.","sidebar":"react"},"react/team-week/pull-requests-with-forks":{"id":"react/team-week/pull-requests-with-forks","title":"Pull Requests with Forks","description":"Many of the JavaScript libraries and tools we use at Epicodus are open source including webpack, React, and Jest, to name a few.
