Then we call the ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"printWeather")," function to print the weather description for the user-inputted city. Why do it here instead of later? Well, there's no reason for users to wait until the Giphy API call is resolved for them to get ",(0,a.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"some")," data. That's a huge advantage of asynchronous code and something you'll see often online \u2014 sites like Facebook and Twitter will give you some data ",(0,a.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"now")," even as they are loading more data to show you ",(0,a.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"later"),".
