It was wonderful to meet Sara and Pablo on the team!\n\nI was happy to learn that the push to include 3D visualization in Lowe's online store is part of an initiative to be more accessible to customers with low mobility. I am even more excited to join a team that values ways technology can include people.\n\nI was thinking about the challenge you described on how to teach customers on using 3D visualization to build more complicated home projects. From my past job as a kindergarten teacher, I found that presenting instructions with enthusiasm and keeping the number of steps low really helps with retention.\n\nTo get back to your question about the testing library I used for my React project \u2014 I was using the React Testing Library from testing-library.com. I prefer using this library because it encourages tests to resemble how the software is actually used.\n\nThanks again and looking forward to hearing from you!\n\nKind regards,\n \n[Your Name]\n[Your LinkedIn profile]\n[Your GitHub Profile]\n \n[Your phone number]\n")),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"It is okay if you don't have something to say on all of these points.
