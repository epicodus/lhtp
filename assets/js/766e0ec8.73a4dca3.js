I decided to attend Epicodus because of my passion for the web and interest in open-source development. Starting day one of class, I became familiar with the command line and Git, and also learned about domain models and SQL databases. At my internship with Digital Designs, I continued to expand my knowledge of web site development, learning PHP on the job and studying at night. I worked on a dashboard for project managers at Digital Designs to see an overview of their projects' statuses and blockers. I collaborated closely with the project managers themselves to make sure the dashboard met their needs and solved their business problems.

My deliverables showed that my detail-oriented approach paid off, as I was consistently in the top 10% of representatives for customer satisfaction. Prior to Healthcare.gov, I was a barista at Lil' Joe's Coffeehouse, where I prided myself on contributing to the fun energy of the company, while staying focused on getting the job done and taking on additional responsibilities to fill in the gaps.
