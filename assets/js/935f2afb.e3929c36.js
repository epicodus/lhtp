Separation of Concerns in Text Analyzer: boldPassage() UI Function","description":"We now have a very basic application where our business and user interface logic are completely separate. Our business logic is tested with pseudocode tests. Our user interface doesn\'t include any business logic. Instead, whenever the UI logic needs to interact with business logic, it calls one of the functions in our business logic.","sidebar":"docs"},"new_arrays_and_looping/separation_of_logic_adding_a_ui_to_text_analyzer":{"id":"new_arrays_and_looping/separation_of_logic_adding_a_ui_to_text_analyzer","title":"28.

You\'ll find it if you test the application out in the browser. This GIF below demonstrates exactly what is happening. In this lesson, we\'ll solve the bug, but we\'ll also do it while keeping our UI and business logic separated. At the end of the lesson, we\'ll look at two examples of poorly separated logic.","sidebar":"docs"},"new_arrays_and_looping/static_versus_instance_with_built_in_js_objects":{"id":"new_arrays_and_looping/static_versus_instance_with_built_in_js_objects","title":"4.

It doesn\'t care about the difference between numbers and words in a string. It returns 1 even when we pass in an empty string. So let\'s keep working on this function and make it better.
