Here are a few guidelines:"),(0,n.kt)("ol",null,(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,n.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Empathy"),". Before you begin, and while writing, imagine what it would be like to be the recipient. If you're reaching out, you probably want or need something from them, right? Perhaps a question answered, help with a project, or your job application considered for an opening. Does your email make them want to help you? Or does it sound rude or demanding?")),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,n.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Subject"),". Subject lines should clearly describe the email's purpose. A couple good subject lines are ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},'"Questions about class schedule"')," and ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},'"Katie Smith said to reach out"'),", because they clearly convey what the email is about. A couple bad subject lines are ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},'"Hello"')," and ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},'"Program"')," because they don't provide any context. Don't be afraid to write a long, descriptive subject either, like ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},'"In town next Tuesday - are you available?"'))),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,n.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Greeting"),". Always begin with a greeting, like ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},'"Hi!"')," or ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},'"Hi Lisa."')," This makes your email feel personal and warm. For example, if your message begins with ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},'"I need your help tomorrow."'),", you'll sound demanding, but if it begins ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},'"Hi Lisa! I need your help tomorrow."'),", you'll sound much more friendly. Most, but not all, emails are also informal, so a formal greeting like ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},'"Dear Lisa"')," is usually overkill.")),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,n.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Message"),". Think about what you want this email to achieve (Are you seeking an answer to a question? Trying to schedule a meeting?) and make it as easy as possible for the recipient to help you achieve it. You can do this by keeping your email short, so your goal isn't buried in too much text or explanation. Also, make any questions or requests as clearly worded as possible, and place them at the end of the email, so they're the last thing the recipient reads before responding. Finally, make sure your tone is professional and respectful - people will be less likely to want to help you if you're rude or sloppy. Use proper grammar, capitalization, and spelling, and don't use informal abbreviations (like ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},'"idk"')," instead of \"I don't know).")),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,n.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Formatting"),". Don't use ALL CAPS for emphasis, ever. This comes across as yelling. Instead, if you need to highlight particular information, use bold,  italics, or put ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"stars around it")," instead. Don't use weird or highly-stylized fonts (like ",(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.google.com/search?q=comic+sans&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjKvNn9tYfgAhVUJTQIHb74A98Q_AUIDigB&biw=1276&bih=1118&dpr=2"},"Comic Sans")," or ",(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.google.com/search?biw=1276&bih=1118&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=GTZKXIWVLoTu9AOc47_4CA&q=papyrus+font&oq=papyrus+font&gs_l=img.3..0l10.26030.27191..27256...0.0..0.54.466.12......1....1..gws-wiz-img.......0i67.2KENsk6k3v8"},"Papyrus"),"), font colors, or unnecessary images either.")),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,n.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Content Editing"),". After writing your email, go back and edit it at least once. (The best writers often edit their writing, including emails, several times.) See if there are parts that could be shorter, clearer, friendlier, or more professional. Read your message out loud to make sure it has the tone you're intending to convey; written word is usually interpreted with the most negative inflection, so go out of your way to make your message sound positive. Ask yourself if there's anything you can do to make it easier for the person to respond to you or complete your request.")),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,n.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Proofreading"),".
